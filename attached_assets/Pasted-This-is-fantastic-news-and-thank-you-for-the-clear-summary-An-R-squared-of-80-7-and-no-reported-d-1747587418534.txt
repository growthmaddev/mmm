This is fantastic news, and thank you for the clear summary! An R-squared of 80.7% and no reported divergences on the real dataset is an excellent outcome for this stage. It strongly validates the core modeling pipeline.

Let's leverage this success immediately. Please proceed with implementing the Budget Optimization Tool as the next major feature.

Here's what we're looking for in the 'Budget Optimization' tab/feature:

Input Current & Desired Budget:

The UI should allow users to see their current spend levels for each channel (which should be available from the input data or model).
Users should be able to input their total current marketing budget.
Users should be able to input a total desired marketing budget for the optimization (this could be the same as current, or an increased/decreased amount).
Optimization Logic (Backend):

The backend should use the parameters from the selected, successfully trained model (e.g., model ID 14). This includes channel coefficients, adstock parameters, and saturation parameters (alpha, lambda) that pymc-marketing uses to define the response curves.
Implement an optimization algorithm (PyMC-Marketing often provides utilities for this, or a common approach involves using the derived response curves to maximize predicted sales/outcome given the budget constraint).
The optimizer should aim to reallocate the desired total budget across the marketing channels to maximize the predicted outcome.
Consider allowing basic constraints, if straightforward for MVP (e.g., "don't reduce any channel below X spend" or "don't increase any channel above Y spend" â€“ though this might be a V2 feature if too complex now). For MVP, an unconstrained optimization (within the total budget) is a good start.
Display Recommendations (UI):

The UI should clearly display:
The recommended spend for each channel.
The predicted total outcome (e.g., sales) with this optimized budget.
The expected lift or change in outcome compared to the current allocation (if a current budget/outcome is provided as a baseline).
Simple bar charts showing current vs. recommended spend per channel would be very effective.
Building the mechanics of this budget optimization, even using the parameters from the current 90-row model, will be a huge step forward for the platform's utility. We can further refine the underlying models and the optimizer's sophistication later.

Please proceed with developing the Budget Optimization feature. Let me know your plan for tackling this!
