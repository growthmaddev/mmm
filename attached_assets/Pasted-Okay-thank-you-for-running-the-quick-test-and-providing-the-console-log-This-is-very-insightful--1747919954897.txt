Okay, thank you for running the quick test and providing the console log! This is very insightful.

The good news is that a lot of the script is working as expected:

The test_config_quick.json is loaded correctly.
Data is loaded, cleaned, and seasonality features are extracted and added to control columns.
Target transformation (log) and predictor scaling (standardize) are being applied.
The logging shows that the get_adaptive_parameters function is picking up or calculating values for adstock and saturation.
The script correctly identifies the PyMC-Marketing version as 0.13.1.
The Bad News: We've hit a Pydantic Validation Error

The key part of the log is the error message:

{"success": false, "error": "Model training error: 1 validation error for AdstockTransformation.__init__\nalpha\n  Unexpected keyword argument [type=unexpected_keyword_argument, input_value=0.5, input_type=float]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/unexpected_keyword_argument"}
Explanation of the Error:

This error means that when train_mmm.py tried to create a GeometricAdstock object (which inherits from AdstockTransformation), it passed alpha as a direct keyword argument (e.g., GeometricAdstock(alpha=0.5040, l_max=8)).
However, for pymc-marketing==0.13.1, the GeometricAdstock class (and its parent AdstockTransformation) does not expect alpha as a direct keyword argument in its __init__ method when you are trying to set a fixed value. Instead, it expects such parameters to be passed within a priors dictionary.

The Agent's previous modification to train_mmm.py changed the instantiation from using a priors dictionary to using direct keyword arguments for these fixed values, which has caused this Pydantic validation error.

The Required Fix in train_mmm.py:

The train_model function in python_scripts/train_mmm.py, specifically where adstock_obj and saturation_obj are created, needs to be adjusted.

Inside the loop for channel_name_key in channel_columns::

For GeometricAdstock:

Change:
Python

adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(alpha=alpha, l_max=l_max)
To (putting alpha back into the priors dictionary):
Python

adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha})
(l_max is generally accepted as a direct argument).
For LogisticSaturation (to be consistent and prevent similar issues):

Change:
Python

saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(L=L, k=k, x0=x0)
To (putting L, k, and x0 into the priors dictionary):
Python

saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L, "k": k, "x0": x0})
This tells PyMC-Marketing that you are providing specific (fixed) values for these parameters, using the structure it expects.

Recommended Next Steps:

Provide the fix to the Agent:
Ask the Agent to make these specific changes to python_scripts/train_mmm.py.

Thank you for confirming the `test_config_quick.json` is suitable.
I ran the quick test, and it failed with a Pydantic validation error:
`"Model training error: 1 validation error for AdstockTransformation.__init__\nalpha\n  Unexpected keyword argument"`

This occurs when `GeometricAdstock` is initialized with `alpha` as a direct keyword argument. For `pymc-marketing==0.13.1`, fixed parameters like `alpha` (and similarly `L`, `k`, `x0` for saturation) should be passed within the `priors` dictionary.

Please modify `python_scripts/train_mmm.py` in the `train_model` function where `adstock_obj` and `saturation_obj` are created:

1. Change:
   `adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(alpha=alpha, l_max=l_max)`
   To:
   `adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha})`

2. Change:
   `saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(L=L, k=k, x0=x0)`
   To:
   `saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L, "k": k, "x0": x0})`

Please make these exact changes.
