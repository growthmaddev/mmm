Agent, your diagnosis is excellent and confirms our suspicion. The empty channel_impact data structures for Model ID 21 are the problem.

Finalize and Verify python_scripts/train_mmm.py (Top Priority):

Action: Please ensure the current version of python_scripts/train_mmm.py includes all the robust logic to:
Extract time-series contributions for baseline, each control_variable, and each marketing_channel from the PyMC-Marketing idata object.
Extract all necessary parameters for response_curves (beta, L, k, x0, adstock per channel) or generate the curve data points.
Calculate and structure total_contributions_summary (with components for baseline, controls, and marketing).
Critically, include historical_channel_spends (this is needed to fix the $0 spend and ROI issue).
Save all of this under the channel_impact key with the detailed nested structure we've discussed (e.g., time_series_decomposition, channel_parameters, etc.), ensuring no fields that should have data are left as empty arrays/objects.
Minimize Fallbacks: While you've mentioned implementing "robust fallback mechanisms," ensure these are truly last resorts. The primary path must be to extract actual data from idata. If critical data like channel_contributions or historical_spends cannot be derived from the model or its inputs, the script should ideally log this clearly.
Generate a Definitive Test Output JSON:

Action: Once you are confident with the train_mmm.py updates, run it to train a new, quick test model. (Use minimal data and MCMC iterations â€“ we need to see the output structure).
Deliverable: Provide a snippet (or link to the full file) of the JSON output generated by THIS test run. This JSON will be our ground truth to confirm train_mmm.py is working perfectly. It must show populated (non-empty) arrays and objects for all expected fields within channel_impact.
Plan for Existing Models (like ID 21) - Post Verification:

Once the JSON from step 2 is verified as correct and complete, we can then discuss the best way to update Model ID 21. This might involve:
If its idata was saved: Creating a script (update_model_channel_impact.py as you attempted, or a function in train_mmm.py) to load Model ID 21's idata and run only the new data extraction logic to generate the channel_impact section.
If its idata wasn't saved or is hard to re-process: Re-training Model ID 21 using the now-perfected train_mmm.py.
Let's get that verified JSON output from a fresh run of the latest train_mmm.py. This is the key to unlocking the 'Channel Impact' tab."

This approach ensures train_mmm.py is fixed and verified first before attempting to either update old models or proceed with further UI work based on potentially still incomplete data
