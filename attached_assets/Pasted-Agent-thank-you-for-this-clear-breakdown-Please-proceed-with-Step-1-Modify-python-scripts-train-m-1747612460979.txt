Agent, thank you for this clear breakdown. Please proceed with Step 1: Modify python_scripts/train_mmm.py to save the necessary model parameters.

Specifically, after a model is successfully fitted, ensure that the results JSON object includes the following for each channel:

Fitted Saturation Parameters:
You mentioned LogisticSaturation is the default. Please identify the specific named parameters that pymc_marketing.MMM fits for this LogisticSaturation function (e.g., for a logistic function, these are often an L parameter for the maximum value/asymptote, a k parameter for the growth rate or steepness, and an x0 parameter for the midpoint or inflection point).
Save the posterior mean (or median) values of these fitted saturation parameters for each channel.
Fitted Channel Coefficient (
beta value):
This is the overall effectiveness multiplier for the channel, post-adstock and post-saturation transformations. Ensure its posterior mean (or median) is saved for each channel.
Fitted Adstock Parameters:
For each channel, save the posterior mean (or median) of its fitted adstock parameters (e.g., the alpha decay rate for geometric adstock, or parameters for other adstock types if used).
Please:

Show me the section of python_scripts/train_mmm.py where you add the logic to extract and include these parameters in the results dictionary before it's converted to JSON.
Provide an example snippet of how the results JSON structure would look for one or two channels, now including these newly saved saturation, coefficient, and adstock parameters. For example:
<!-- end list -->

JSON

// ... other results ...
"channels": {
  "TV": {
    "roi": 3.16,
    "contribution_percentage": 0.25,
    "beta_coefficient": 1500.5, // Example
    "adstock_alpha": 0.45,       // Example
    "saturation_L": 200000.0,    // Example (max sales from channel)
    "saturation_k": 0.0005,      // Example (steepness)
    "saturation_x0": 50000.0     // Example (midpoint)
    // ... any other per-channel results ...
  },
  "Social": {
    // ... similar parameters ...
  }
},
// ... other results ...
(The exact parameter names for saturation will depend on what LogisticSaturation in PyMC-Marketing uses and how they are stored in the fitted model object.)

Once we have these essential parameters being saved, we can then confidently move on to creating the Python utility script for the marginal return-based optimization (Option B)."

This first step is crucial, as without these parameters, we cannot build the more sophisticated optimizer. Let me know how you get on with updating train_mmm.py!
