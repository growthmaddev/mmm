It sounds like you've got a clear plan to tackle the remaining issues with the Budget Optimizer. Your approach of developing and validating the "completely updated version of the core optimizer function" (potentially in enhanced_optimizer.py by drawing from the successful logic in budget_optimizer_fix.py) and then integrating that into the main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is a smart way to manage the complexity, especially with a large script.

The goal remains to ensure that the live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script accurately reflects all the successful elements that produced the promising test results (e.g., +27% to +45% lift and improved budget diversity). This includes correct handling of:

baseline_sales (intercept)
Channel response curves (betas, adstock, saturation parameters like L, k, x0)
Marginal ROI calculations
Iterative budget allocation logic
Lift calculation
Please continue with your plan to create and integrate this updated core optimizer function into python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.

Once you are confident that this comprehensive update to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is complete:

Confirm Application of Fixes: Briefly confirm that the new, improved optimizer function is now fully part of the python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py that the server will call.

Run Full End-to-End Tests from UI:

Then, please run our two standard test scenarios by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785.
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000.
Report Back with UI Output and Detailed Logs for Scenario B:

For both scenarios, please show me the final UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation breakdown, Expected Outcome, and Lift %). We are looking for results that align with the success of your budget_optimizer_fix.py script (i.e., significant positive lift and better diversity).
For Scenario B (the increased budget scenario), also provide the detailed server-side log output from the now updated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log must clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, its calculated sales contribution for the initial spend, and its calculated sales contribution for the optimized spend.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (sum of initial contributions + baseline_sales).
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (sum of optimized contributions + baseline_sales).
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used.
I'm optimistic that this focused effort to transfer the successful logic will resolve the issues. Let me know when you've updated the main script and are ready to test from the UI!
