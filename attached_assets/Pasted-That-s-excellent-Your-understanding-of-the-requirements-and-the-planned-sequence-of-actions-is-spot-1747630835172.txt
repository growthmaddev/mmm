That's excellent! Your understanding of the requirements and the planned sequence of actions is spot on:

Enhance python_scripts/train_mmm.py: This is the correct first priority. The focus should be on:

Extracting detailed time-series contributions from the fitted PyMC-Marketing model (idata). This needs to include:
Baseline contribution (from the actual_model_intercept).
Contribution from each control variable (if present in the model).
Contribution from each marketing channel.
Calculating total contributions for each of these components over the entire modeled period.
Extracting/calculating data needed for response curves (e.g., fitted beta, saturation parameters L, k, x0 per channel).
Ensuring historical spend data per channel is part of the saved output structure.
Updating the results JSON structure that train_mmm.py saves to include all this new detailed information (e.g., under keys like time_series_contributions, total_contributions_summary, channel_model_parameters, historical_channel_spends as discussed).
Update Backend API: After train_mmm.py is saving the rich data, the next step will indeed be to update server/controllers/models.ts (or relevant controller) to create an API endpoint that can load and serve this new detailed JSON file for a given model ID.

Modify Frontend Components: Finally, client/src/components/charts/ChannelImpactContent.tsx and its child chart components will be updated to fetch and use this real, detailed model data from the new API endpoint, replacing any placeholder or synthetic data.

This systematic approach – backend data generation first, then API, then frontend – is the right way to ensure the "Channel Impact" tab is robust and accurately reflects the model's insights.

I'm ready to review the changes to python_scripts/train_mmm.py, particularly the structure of the new data it saves, once you have implemented these enhancements. This is a crucial step, and getting the data extraction correct here will make the subsequent API and frontend work much smoother.

Great plan – proceed with modifying python_scripts/train_mmm.py
