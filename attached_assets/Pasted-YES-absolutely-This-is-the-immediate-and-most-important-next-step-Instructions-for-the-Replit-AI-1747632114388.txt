YES, absolutely! This is the immediate and most important next step.

Instructions for the Replit AI Agent:

Run python_scripts/train_mmm.py for Model ID 14:

Execute the training script for Model ID 14. This will regenerate its results, including the new detailed JSON output file containing all the data structures you've just implemented (e.g., model_14_detailed_impact_data.json or whatever naming convention is used).
Provide a Snippet of the Generated JSON Output:

After the script runs, please provide a representative snippet of the actual JSON output file that was generated for Model ID 14 by train_mmm.py.
We need to see the structure and some sample data for:
time_series_decomposition (showing dates, baseline, and at least one control_variable (if applicable to Model ID 14) and one marketing_channel series).
total_contributions_summary (showing the aggregated totals).
channel_parameters (for one channel, showing its beta, L, k, x0, adstock).
response_curves data (for one channel).
historical_channel_spends (for one channel).
The distinct percentage metrics (percent_of_total vs. percent_of_marketing) if they are pre-calculated and stored here, or confirm that the raw contributions needed for the frontend to calculate them are present.
Confirm Data Points:

Specifically confirm that the actual_model_intercept for Model ID 14 (which we previously determined was near zero) is being correctly used as the basis for the baseline contribution in the time-series and total contributions.
If Model ID 14 uses any control variables, confirm their contributions are also being extracted and saved.
Why this verification is crucial before moving to API/Frontend:

Ensures train_mmm.py is truly producing all the necessary data.
Confirms the data is in the correct structure that the backend API and frontend components will expect.
Allows us to catch any discrepancies or missing pieces at the source (the Python script) before spending time on API or UI integration based on potentially incomplete or misformatted data.
Once we've verified this JSON output from train_mmm.py for Model ID 14, the subsequent steps of updating the API to serve this file and then updating ChannelImpactContent.tsx to consume and display it will be much more straightforward and likely to succeed quickly.

Looking forward to seeing the JSON output snippet! This is great progress.
