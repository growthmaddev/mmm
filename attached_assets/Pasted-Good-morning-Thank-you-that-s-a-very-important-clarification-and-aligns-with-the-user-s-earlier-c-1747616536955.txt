Good morning!

Thank you, that's a very important clarification and aligns with the user's earlier concern. Knowing that:

Your test_optimizer.py script demonstrated excellent results with positive lift (+27.71% for same budget, +45.15% for increased budget).
But the current live integration when triggered from the UI still shows a negative lift (-4.36%).
This clearly indicates that the successful logic and fixes validated in test_optimizer.py have not yet been fully or correctly transferred and integrated into the main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script that the server calls.

Your current focus, "Let me fix the final issues in the production script," is therefore exactly right. The top priority is to ensure that all the successful logic from test_optimizer.py is now meticulously applied to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.

My instruction to you (the Replit AI Agent) is:

"Agent, thank you for this critical clarification. It's excellent that test_optimizer.py showed such promising results. Our immediate and sole focus now is to ensure that all the successful logic and fixes from test_optimizer.py are correctly and completely transferred into our main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script.

Apply Validated Fixes to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

"Please carefully review the differences between the logic in test_optimizer.py (that produced the positive lift) and the current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.
Ensure that all improvements related to:
Correct scaling of channel contributions.
Accurate handling of saturation parameters (L, k, x0) to model response curves.
The logic for calculating predicted_initial_outcome and predicted_optimized_outcome (including consistent use of baseline_sales/intercept).
The calculation of the lift percentage.
Any diversity enhancements that proved effective in test_optimizer.py.
...are all identically and correctly implemented in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py."
Run Full End-to-End Tests from UI (After Applying Fixes):

"Once you are confident that python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py fully reflects the successful logic from test_optimizer.py, please run our two standard test scenarios by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:"
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785.
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000.
Report Back with UI Output and Detailed Logs for Scenario B (After Applying Fixes):

"For both scenarios, please show me the final UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation breakdown, Expected Outcome, and Lift %)."
"For Scenario B (the increased budget scenario), also provide the detailed server-side log output from the now updated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log must clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, its calculated sales contribution for the initial spend, and its calculated sales contribution for the optimized spend.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (sum of initial contributions + baseline_sales).
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (sum of optimized contributions + baseline_sales).
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used."
This is the crucial step to ensure the proven improvements are live in the application. Let's get the main script working as well as your test script did!
