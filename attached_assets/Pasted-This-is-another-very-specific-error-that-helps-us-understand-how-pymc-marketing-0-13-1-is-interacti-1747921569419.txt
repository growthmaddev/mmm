This is another very specific error that helps us understand how pymc-marketing==0.13.1 is interacting with the fixed parameters.

Understanding the New Error:

Error Message: AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute 'dims'
Location: The error still originates from the same line in pymc_marketing/mmm/mmm.py (line 658, in the default_model_config property): if dist.dims != ("channel",):
Cause:
We correctly changed pm.Constant.dist() to pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=value).
pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=value) creates a PyMC TensorVariable representing the constant value.
When the MMM class internally tries to build its default model configuration, it accesses these "priors" (which are now TensorVariable constants). When it assigns one of these to its internal variable dist and then tries to check dist.dims, the error occurs because these TensorVariable constants (from DiracDelta) do not have a .dims attribute in the same way that full random variables (like pm.Normal.dist(), pm.Beta.dist()) do.
Essentially, the MMM class expects any parameter it pulls from the adstock/saturation priors to behave like a full PyMC random variable regarding the .dims attribute.
The Solution: Use Narrowly Defined Learnable Priors to Represent Fixed Values

Since providing a direct constant via DiracDelta (which results in a TensorVariable without the expected .dims) doesn't work, the next best approach is to provide a proper PyMC random variable distribution that is so narrowly defined around our desired fixed value that it's effectively constant. This will ensure the object has the .dims attribute (usually () for scalar parameters).

We can use a Normal distribution with a very small sigma (standard deviation).

Here's how to instruct the Replit AI Agent to modify python_scripts/train_mmm.py:

Thank you for running the test. We have a new, very specific error:
`AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute 'dims'`

This occurs in `pymc_marketing` because when it inspects the `pm.DiracDelta.dist()` objects we provided for fixed parameters, these `TensorVariable` constants don't have the `.dims` attribute it expects.

To resolve this, we'll use a common workaround: define these fixed parameters using a `pm.Normal` distribution with a mean equal to our desired fixed value and a very small standard deviation (sigma). This makes them effectively constant but provides a full distribution object that `pymc-marketing` should handle correctly.

Please modify the `train_model` function in `python_scripts/train_mmm.py` as follows:

Inside the loop `for channel_name_key in channel_columns:`, where `adstock_obj` and `saturation_obj` are created:

1.  **For `GeometricAdstock`'s `alpha` parameter:**
    * Change:
        ```python
        alpha_dist = pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=alpha) # alpha is the float value
        adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha_dist})
        ```
    * To (using a very small sigma, e.g., 0.001):
        ```python
        alpha_dist = pm.Normal.dist(mu=alpha, sigma=0.001) # alpha is the float value
        adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha_dist})
        ```

2.  **For `LogisticSaturation`'s `L`, `k`, and `x0` parameters:**
    * Change:
        ```python
        L_dist = pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=L)
        k_dist = pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=k)
        x0_dist = pm.DiracDelta.dist(c=x0)
        saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L_dist, "k": k_dist, "x0": x0_dist})
        ```
    * To (using appropriately small sigmas; for k and x0, sigma might need to be relative to their magnitude or a small absolute value if they are not zero. If L, k, or x0 can be 0, HalfNormal might be safer for sigma if the parameter must be positive, but for now, let's try Normal with small sigma. Ensure sigma is always positive.):
        ```python
        L_dist = pm.Normal.dist(mu=L, sigma=0.001) # L is the float value
        k_dist = pm.Normal.dist(mu=k, sigma=max(abs(k * 0.001), 0.000001)) # k is the float value, ensure sigma is positive and small
        x0_dist = pm.Normal.dist(mu=x0, sigma=max(abs(x0 * 0.001), 0.1))  # x0 is the float value, ensure sigma is positive and small relative to x0
        saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L_dist, "k": k_dist, "x0": x0_dist})
        ```
        *(Note on sigmas for k and x0: Using a small relative sigma, e.g., 0.1% of the value, but ensuring a minimum absolute sigma to prevent it from being zero if k or x0 are very small or zero. Adjust these small sigma values if needed, but the principle is to make them very narrow distributions.)*

Ensure `import pymc as pm` is present at the top of `train_mmm.py`.

These changes provide full distribution objects that will have the `.dims` attribute, hopefully satisfying the `MMM` class's internal checks while keeping the parameters effectively fixed to the values from your configuration.

After you've made these exact modifications, please confirm, and I will run the quick verification test again with `test_config_quick.json`.
