Good morning!

Thank you for running the scenario and for the summary. There are some critical discrepancies between the UI output you shared for Scenario B and your own summary of achievements, particularly concerning the lift percentage and the interpretation of "baseline spending." This indicates we still have some way to go to ensure the optimizer's calculations are robust and clearly understood.

Let's clarify based on the UI output you provided for Scenario B (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000):

UI Expected Outcome: $1,009,575
UI Lift: +50.0%
UI Allocation (Top 3): PPCBrand $76,271, PPCNonBrand $76,271, PPCShopping $72,458. (Total for top 3 = $225,000, which is 75% of the $300,000 budget).
Now, comparing this to your summary where you mentioned: "Successfully achieved expected lift of 0.5% with baseline spending of $1,008,925."

If the "baseline spending" of $1,008,925 refers to the predicted outcome from the initial $201,785 budget, and the new "Expected Outcome" for the $300,000 budget is $1,009,575 (from the UI), then:
The absolute increase in outcome is $1,009,575 - $1,008,925 = $650.
The percentage lift would be ($650 / $1,008,925) * 100 = approximately 0.064%.
This 0.064% lift is vastly different from the +50.0% lift shown in the UI. This indicates a major inconsistency in how "lift" is being calculated or how the "Expected Outcome" numbers are being generated and interpreted by the UI versus what your internal analysis of the script suggests.
A 50% lift on an initial outcome of ~$1M would result in a new outcome of ~$1.5M, not ~$1.009M.
The budget concentration, while perhaps slightly more diverse than the worst previous runs, is still very high (75% in the top 3 channels for the increased budget scenario).

Given these persistent challenges and the conflicting numbers, and your direct question: "Should I revert to previous test script logic that showed better lift percentages, or continue refining the current approach?"

My Recommendation is:

Let's lean towards understanding and replicating the success of your previous test script logic that showed better (and hopefully more verifiably calculated) lift percentages and diversity. If you have a version of the optimization logic (from test_optimizer.py or budget_optimizer_fix.py) that you are confident produced results like "+27.71% lift for same budget" and "+45.15% lift for increased budget" with "~57% concentration in top 2 channels," and importantly, if the way it calculated those outcomes and lift was sound, then our primary goal should be to ensure that specific logic is now perfectly and completely implemented within python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.

Therefore, please focus on the following:

Implement/Verify "Known Good" Logic:

"Please ensure that the core calculation logic within the current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py precisely mirrors the logic from your most successful test script â€“ the one that yielded results like +27% to +45% lift and better diversity (~57% concentration)."
"This includes how that script handled:
The baseline_sales (intercept).
Individual channel response curves (using beta coefficients, adstock parameters, and the correctly interpreted saturation parameters L, k, x0 for each channel).
The iterative marginal ROI-based budget allocation.
The calculation of predicted_initial_outcome and predicted_optimized_outcome.
The final lift calculation."
Provide Detailed Trace from the Updated optimize_budget_marginal.py:

"Once you are confident that python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py now truly reflects this known good logic, please run Scenario B again (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14 parameters)."
"Then, provide the complete server-side log output from this run of the updated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log is essential and MUST clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each marketing channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, the key parameters used for it by the optimizer (beta, L, k, x0, adstock parameters), its calculated sales contribution based on initial spend, and its calculated sales contribution based on optimized spend.
The sum of channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The calculated lift percentage, clearly showing the two total outcome values used in its comparison."
"Also, please show the UI output for this Scenario B run after these changes."
Let's not introduce new "diversity protection" layers or scaling factor adjustments at this exact moment. The priority is to ensure the fundamental marginal return optimization engine, as successfully prototyped in your test script, is correctly implemented and demonstrably working in optimize_budget_marginal.py, producing consistent and verifiable lift and allocation numbers. We need to build from that known good baseline.
