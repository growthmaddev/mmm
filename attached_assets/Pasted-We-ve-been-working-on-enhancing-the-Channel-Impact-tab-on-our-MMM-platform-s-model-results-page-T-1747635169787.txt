We've been working on enhancing the 'Channel Impact' tab on our MMM platform's model results page. The goal is to display actual model-driven insights, including:

Contribution Over Time Chart: Stacked area chart showing time-series contributions from baseline, control variables (if any), and each marketing channel.
Contribution Analysis Table: With distinct '% of Total Outcome' and '% of Marketing Driven Outcome' for each channel, plus correct ROI and historical spend.
Response Curves Chart: Showing spend vs. response for each channel.
Current Status & Problem:

The python_scripts/train_mmm.py script was recently updated with the intention of extracting and saving a detailed JSON structure containing all necessary data for the above (time-series decomposition, total contributions, channel parameters for response curves, historical spends, etc.).
The frontend component (client/src/components/charts/ChannelImpactContent.tsx) was also updated to expect this real data and show 'No data available' messages if fields are missing.
A previous NameError in train_mmm.py was reportedly fixed.
However, after training a NEW model with what should be the updated train_mmm.py, the 'Channel Impact' tab still shows:
"No time series data available from the model."
"No response curve data available from the model."
In the Contribution Analysis table: "% of Total Outcome" and "% of Marketing Driven Outcome" are identical, ROI is "0.00x," and Spend is "$0" for all channels.
This indicates the frontend is not receiving the correct detailed data. The most likely cause is that python_scripts/train_mmm.py is still not successfully generating and saving all the required detailed data in the precise structure expected, or the API is not serving this new structure for the latest model.

Your Immediate Task: Debug the Data Output and Pipeline for the 'Channel Impact' Tab.

Step 1: Verify Output of python_scripts/train_mmm.py (CRUCIAL):

Action: Please inspect the output generated by python_scripts/train_mmm.py for the MOST RECENTLY TRAINED MODEL (the one that resulted in the UI issues described above). This output should be a JSON file.
Provide a snippet of this actual JSON output. We need to meticulously check if it contains the following fully populated structures:
time_series_decomposition: With dates, baseline series, control_variables (as an object with series for each, if any), and marketing_channels (as an object with series for each). Are these fields present and filled with numerical data?
response_curves_data or channel_parameters: Containing fitted beta, L, k, x0, and adstock parameters for each channel. Is this present and populated?
total_contributions_summary: With aggregated totals for baseline, each control_variable, each marketing_channel, total_marketing_contribution, and overall_total_predicted_outcome. Is this present and correct?
historical_channel_spends: An object or list providing the total historical spend for each channel. Is this present and populated with non-zero values? This is critical for the $0 spend and ROI issue.
Step 2: If train_mmm.py Output is Still Incomplete/Incorrect:

Action: You must modify python_scripts/train_mmm.py to ensure it correctly calculates, extracts from the PyMC-Marketing idata object, and saves all the fields listed above in a consistent and accessible JSON structure.
Pay close attention to extracting time-series for each component (baseline, controls, channels).
Ensure all necessary parameters for response curves are extracted per channel.
Critically, ensure historical_channel_spends are correctly retrieved and saved.
Re-run training for a quick test model with the fixed train_mmm.py to generate a new, corrected JSON output. Provide the updated JSON snippet for verification.
Step 3: Verify API Endpoint (server/controllers/models.ts or similar):

Action: Once train_mmm.py produces the correct detailed JSON, confirm the API endpoint serving the model results is loading and returning this entire detailed JSON structure to the frontend.
Step 4: Verify Frontend Consumption (client/src/components/charts/ChannelImpactContent.tsx):

Action: Ensure the React components are using the correct paths/keys to access the data within the JSON structure for all charts and the table, particularly for the spend and ROI figures, and the two distinct percentage calculations.
Let's start by rigorously examining the JSON output of the LATEST train_mmm.py run for the newly trained model. The problems in the UI are direct symptoms of missing or incorrectly structured data from this source.
