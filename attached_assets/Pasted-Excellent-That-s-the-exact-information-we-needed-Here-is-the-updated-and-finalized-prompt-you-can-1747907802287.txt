Excellent! That's the exact information we needed.

Here is the updated and finalized prompt you can send to the Replit AI Agent. I've inserted the correct file path for dankztestdata_v2.csv.

Final Prompt for the Replit AI Agent:

Hi Agent,

We need to prepare for a robust manual test run of the latest `train_mmm.py`. The user has made an update to the data file.

Please help with the following:

1.  **Create a New Configuration File:**
    * Create a new JSON configuration file: `robust_test_config_v1.json`.
    * Store it in an organized location (e.g., `python_scripts/configs/`).

2.  **Populate the Configuration File:**
    * **Data File:**
        * The user has updated the primary data file to include a new control variable column: `interestrate_control` (this column contains float values).
        * Please ensure the `data_filename` in the config points to this **updated data file** located at: `MarketMixMaster/attached_assets/dankztestdata_v2.csv`.
    * **Key settings for this robust test:**
        * `auto_transform_target`: `true` (Preferred. If this boolean flag isn't implemented, please use `target_transform_method`: `"log"`).
        * `scale_predictors_method`: `"standardize"`.
        * `mcmc_draws`: `2000`
        * `mcmc_tune`: `1000`
        * `mcmc_chains`: `4`
    * **Control Columns:**
        * The `control_columns` list in the configuration **must include** `"interestrate_control"`.
        * **Additionally, for seasonality controls:**
            a.  Can `train_mmm.py` automatically generate and use basic seasonality features (e.g., month, quarter, day_of_week derived from the date column) as controls from this updated data file (`MarketMixMaster/attached_assets/dankztestdata_v2.csv`)?
            b.  If yes, please enable/configure this, and add these derived column names to the `control_columns` list in the config (alongside `"interestrate_control"`).
            c.  If `train_mmm.py` cannot auto-generate seasonality controls, please still ensure `"interestrate_control"` is in `control_columns`. In this case, also provide guidance on what specific *additional* seasonality/event columns (and their expected format) we should prepare in the CSV for a subsequent, more comprehensive test run.
    * **Other necessary parameters:** Ensure all other standard parameters for `train_mmm.py` are present (e.g., `date_column`, `target_column`, `spend_columns`, `event_columns` (if any, set to `[]` if not applicable beyond controls), adstock/saturation settings to encourage learning, etc.). You might need to refer to the column names in `MarketMixMaster/attached_assets/dankztestdata_v2.csv` to correctly populate `spend_columns`, `date_column`, and `target_column`.
    * Please list out the full contents of the `robust_test_config_v1.json` you create.

3.  **Ensure `train_mmm.py` Compatibility:**
    * Verify `train_mmm.py` can be called with this new config file, ideally via a command-line argument for the config path (e.g., `python python_scripts/train_mmm.py --config_path python_scripts/configs/robust_test_config_v1.json`).
    * Provide the exact command I should use in the Replit shell.

4.  **Future Use:**
    * Remember the goal of easily managing different config versions for various tests, potentially linking to web app triggered runs later.

Please proceed and let me know the command to run the test, confirming the full path to the (updated) data file used and the contents of `robust_test_config_v1.json`.
