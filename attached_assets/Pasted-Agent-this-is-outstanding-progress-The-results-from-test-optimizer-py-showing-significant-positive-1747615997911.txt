Agent, this is outstanding progress! The results from test_optimizer.py showing significant positive lift and improved budget diversity are exactly what we needed. This demonstrates you've cracked the core issues with the outcome calculation and allocation logic.

Now, let's ensure this successful logic is transferred to our main application:

Apply Fixes to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

"Please apply the validated fixes and logic from your test_optimizer.py directly into our primary python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script. Ensure that all the improvements related to scaling, saturation parameter handling, lift calculation, and diversity enhancement that you've tested are now part of this main script."
Run Full End-to-End Tests from UI:

"Once python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is updated with this new, validated logic, please run our two standard test scenarios by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:"
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000
Report Back with UI Output and Detailed Logs for Scenario B:

"For both scenarios, please show me the final UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation breakdown, Expected Outcome, and Lift %)."
"For Scenario B (the increased budget scenario), also provide the detailed server-side log output from the now updated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log should clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used from Model ID 14.
For each channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, its calculated sales contribution for the initial spend, and its calculated sales contribution for the optimized spend.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (sum of initial contributions + baseline_sales).
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (sum of optimized contributions + baseline_sales) â€“ this is the "Expected Outcome."
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used in the comparison."
This will confirm that the excellent fixes you've developed in the test environment are now working correctly within the full application, and we can finally see realistic and actionable budget optimization recommendations in the UI. I'm very excited to see these results!
