Hi Agent,

Thank you for extracting the metrics for model 25. The results (R-squared ~2.89%, very low scaled intercept ~36.08), even with increased MCMC sampling, indicate that we need to investigate the `train_mmm.py` script more deeply.

Before we dive into broader model improvements, please confirm the status of the **"$0 spend display bug"**:

**Task 1: Confirm Fix for Channel Spend Display (Verify Previous Task)**
    a.  In your last set of actions, you were tasked with fixing the issue where all channels displayed $0 spend in the "Channel Performance Details" table on the "Channel Impact" tab of `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`/results.tsx].
    b.  Please confirm:
        * Is `train_mmm.py` now correctly calculating the **total actual spend for each channel** and including it in its JSON output? (e.g., in `analytics.channel_effectiveness_detail[channelName].actual_spend` or a similar field).
        * Does the "Channel Performance Details" table now correctly display these distinct, accurate total spend figures for each channel?
    c.  If this is not yet fully resolved, please complete and verify this fix first. This is essential for basic data integrity in the UI.

**Task 2: Investigate and Refine Core Model Logic in `train_mmm.py`**
Once Task 1 is confirmed, let's address the underlying model fit issues. Focus on these areas within `train_mmm.py`:

    a.  **Implement Model-Derived Channel Contributions:**
        * The current channel contribution calculation (around line 200-207 in the prior version of `train_mmm.py`) is a manual heuristic. This is likely a significant factor in model inaccuracy and interpretation.
        * Modify the script to use **model-derived contribution measures** directly from the fitted PyMC-Marketing `mmm` object. Research the appropriate methods for your version of PyMC-Marketing (e.g., `mmm.get_channel_contributions()`, `mmm.plot_channel_contributions_grid()`, or inspecting `idata` for contribution-related variables that can be summed per channel over time).
        * These model-derived contributions should replace the manual heuristic for populating contribution figures in the JSON output (both for overall summaries and for time-series breakdowns in `analytics.sales_decomposition`).

    b.  **Re-evaluate Intercept Extraction and Scaling:**
        * The `extract_model_intercept` function is comprehensive in *finding* an intercept term. However, the resulting *scaled* baseline sales (`total_baseline_sales`) remains extremely low (e.g., 36.08 for model 25) compared to total sales.
        * Investigate if the raw intercept value itself learned by the model is indeed this small.
        * Are there any data scaling practices in `load_data()` or within the PyMC-Marketing model setup that might lead to an intercept on a vastly different scale than the final sales figures?
        * Ensure the `summary.actual_model_intercept` in the final JSON output remains the *total baseline sales over the period* (raw intercept * number of data points).

    c.  **Review Adstock/Saturation Parameter Handling:**
        * The script often falls back to default adstock/saturation parameters if extraction from the model summary fails.
        * When model 25 (with increased MCMC) was run, were sensible, distinct parameters for adstock (e.g., `alpha`) and saturation (e.g., `L`, `k`, `x0`) actually extracted for different channels from the `az.summary(idata)` or `model_direct_params`? Or did it still rely heavily on defaults? Report on this.

**Deliverables:**
1.  Confirmation (and if necessary, updated code for `train_mmm.py` and/or `results.tsx`) that the channel spend display (Task 1) is correctly showing actual total spends.
2.  Updated `train_mmm.py` with:
    * Implementation of model-derived channel contributions (Task 2a).
    * Any refinements to intercept handling logic or findings from that investigation (Task 2b).
3.  A summary report detailing:
    * Your findings on adstock/saturation parameter extraction for model 25 (Task 2c).
    * How model-derived contributions were implemented and how they compare conceptually to the previous heuristic.
    * Any insights into why the scaled intercept remains so low.

We need to improve the core model outputs from `train_mmm.py` to build trustworthy analyses. We will hold off on further frontend work (like the "Technical Details" tab or Phase 3 visualizations) until we make progress on these fundamental model quality issues. You can revert the MCMC settings in `train_mmm.py` back to the faster ones (e.g., `draws=200, tune=100`) *after* you've completed the investigations that required the longer run, to allow for quicker iterations on these specific logic changes.
