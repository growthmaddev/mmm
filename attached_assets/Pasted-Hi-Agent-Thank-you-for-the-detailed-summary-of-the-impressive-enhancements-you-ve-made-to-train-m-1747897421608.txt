Hi Agent,

Thank you for the detailed summary of the impressive enhancements you've made to `train_mmm.py`, especially around advanced data transformations and reporting. This shows great initiative.

To ensure we're aligned with the specific tasks from my last prompt ("Implement Critical Model Enhancements & Diagnostics in `train_mmm.py`"), could you please provide some clarifications:

1.  **Data-Driven Adstock & Saturation Parameters (Task 1 from previous prompt):**
    * Your summary mentions "Data-Driven Adaptive Parameters" and "enhanced parameter extraction with adaptive fallback parameters."
    * Could you detail how specifically the **adstock parameters (`alpha`, `l_max`)** and **saturation parameters (`L`, `k`, `x0`)** for each channel are now being handled?
    * Are they now more data-driven or learnable by the model for individual channels, moving away from the previous reliance on global defaults (as identified in model 26)? Please provide brief examples or explain the mechanism if possible.

2.  **Scaling of Predictor Variables (Part of Task 2 from previous prompt):**
    * My previous prompt asked for an option to standardize/scale predictor variables (channel spends and control variables), for example, using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`.
    * Was this feature implemented? If so, how is it configured?

3.  **Comprehensive Data Diagnostic Checks (Task 3 from previous prompt):**
    * My previous prompt requested the implementation of a `run_diagnostics` function to check for data volume, spend-sales correlations, collinearity (e.g., via PCA), and target variable stationarity (e.g., via ADF test), with results in a `"data_diagnostics_report"` section of the JSON output.
    * Your summary focused on "Enhanced Results Reporting" related to transformations and model metrics. Was the broader `run_diagnostics` function with the checks mentioned above also implemented? If so, could you provide an example of its output?

Regarding your question, *"What would you like me to focus on next?"*:
Once we have these clarifications, we can assess the current state and then decide on the next steps, which will likely involve testing these new capabilities with a model run and then potentially moving to implement any outstanding parts of the diagnostics or further model refinements.
