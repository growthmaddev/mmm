Proposed Changes for MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

Ensure Core Helper Functions from budget_optimizer_fix.py are Present and Identical:

logistic_saturation(x, L, k, x0) function:
Action: Verify or replace the logistic_saturation function in optimize_budget_marginal.py with the exact version from budget_optimizer_fix.py (lines ~10-30), including the numerical stability checks (exponent > 100, exponent < -100).
Reasoning: Ensures accurate and stable saturation calculation.
get_channel_response(spend, beta, saturation_params) function:
Action: Verify or replace the get_channel_response function with the version from budget_optimizer_fix.py (lines ~10-30). This includes how it calls logistic_saturation and handles default saturation parameters (L, k, x0).
Reasoning: Guarantees correct channel response calculation based on spend, beta, and saturation.
calculate_marginal_return(beta, current_spend, saturation_params, increment) function:
Action: Verify or replace/add the calculate_marginal_return function with the exact version you provided from budget_optimizer_fix.py.
Reasoning: This is crucial for the optimization algorithm to correctly assess where additional spend yields the most return.
Integrate the Scaling Factor:

Action:
Introduce scaling_factor = 300.0 (or ensure it's configurable if desired, but start with the proven value).
Identify where "raw contributions" are calculated for each channel (likely after get_channel_response). Apply this scaling_factor there: scaled_contribution = raw_channel_response * scaling_factor.
Ensure that total_current_contribution and total_optimized_contribution are sums of these scaled contributions.
Reasoning: To make channel contributions and total outcomes meaningful and align with the successful test script.
Implement the Core Optimization Algorithm (Iterative Allocation with Diversity):

This is likely the most complex part to integrate. The main optimization function in optimize_budget_marginal.py needs to follow this structure from budget_optimizer_fix.py (lines ~130-180):
Initialization:
min_channel_budget = 1000.0 (or make configurable).
optimized_allocation = {channel: min_channel_budget for channel in current_allocation}.
remaining_budget = desired_budget - sum(optimized_allocation.values()).
increment = 100.0 (or similar small spend unit, ensure this matches budget_optimizer_fix.py).
Iterative Allocation Loop (e.g., for i in range(1000) or while remaining_budget >= increment):
Calculate marginal_returns for all channels using calculate_marginal_return(beta, current_spend_in_channel, saturation_params, increment).
Diversity Enhancement Logic:
Implement the exact diversity adjustment logic as shown in budget_optimizer_fix.py (lines ~150-170, calculating channel_percentage and diversity_factor = max(0.1, 1.0 - (channel_percentage * 2.0)), then adjusted_mr = mr * diversity_factor). This logic should be inside the main allocation loop.
Find best_channel = max(adjusted_returns, key=adjusted_returns.get).
Check if adjusted_returns[best_channel] <= 0. If so, and you still have budget, it implies no channel offers a positive adjusted marginal return. How this is handled in budget_optimizer_fix.py (e.g., distribute remaining proportionally or stop) should be replicated. If budget_optimizer_fix.py continues to allocate to the "least negative" or zero MR channel, replicate that. If it stops or distributes proportionally, do that.
optimized_allocation[best_channel] += increment.
remaining_budget -= increment.
Reasoning: To replicate the successful allocation strategy that balances marginal returns with diversity.
Implement Correct Lift Calculation:

Action: Replace the current lift calculation in optimize_budget_marginal.py with the nuanced logic from budget_optimizer_fix.py (lines ~310-350).
Calculate total_current_contribution (sum of scaled responses from initial spends).
Calculate current_total_outcome = baseline_sales + total_current_contribution.
Calculate expected_optimized_contribution (sum of scaled responses from optimized_allocation).
Calculate expected_outcome = baseline_sales + expected_optimized_contribution.
standard_lift_pct = ((expected_outcome / current_total_outcome) - 1) * 100 if current_total_outcome > 0 else 0.
budget_diff = desired_budget - initial_total_budget.
Conditional Lift based on budget_diff:
If abs(budget_diff) > 5000 (or a similar significant threshold):
If budget_diff > 0:
current_roi = total_current_contribution / initial_total_budget if initial_total_budget > 0 else 0.
projected_contribution = total_current_contribution + (budget_diff * current_roi).
projected_outcome = baseline_sales + projected_contribution.
roi_adjusted_lift = ((expected_outcome / projected_outcome) - 1) * 100 if projected_outcome > 0 else 0.
final_lift = roi_adjusted_lift.
Else (budget_diff < 0): final_lift = standard_lift_pct.
Else: final_lift = standard_lift_pct.
final_lift = max(-50, min(100, final_lift)) (or appropriate bounds).
Reasoning: To accurately reflect the optimizer's performance, especially when comparing scenarios with different total budgets.
Parameter Handling and main function structure:

Action: Ensure the main function in optimize_budget_marginal.py correctly parses inputs (desired budget, current allocations, channel parameters including betas and saturation L, k, x0, and baseline_sales/intercept).
The structure of channel_params should be a dictionary where keys are channel names, and values are dictionaries like {"beta": b, "saturation_params": {"L": l, "k": k, "x0": x0}}.
baseline_sales (intercept) must be correctly read and added to total contributions to get total outcomes.
Reasoning: Correct inputs are fundamental for correct outputs.
Detailed Logging for Verification:

Action: Throughout the optimize_budget_marginal.py script, especially in the modified sections, add comprehensive print statements or use the logging module. These should match the type of logs that helped verify budget_optimizer_fix.py:
Input parameters (desired budget, initial allocations, channel betas, L, k, x0, baseline_sales, scaling_factor).
Initial state: total_current_contribution, current_total_outcome.
During optimization loop: marginal_returns for channels, adjusted_returns after diversity, best_channel chosen, remaining_budget.
Optimized state: optimized_allocation (final spends per channel), expected_optimized_contribution, expected_outcome.
Lift calculation: standard_lift_pct, budget_diff, current_roi (if used), projected_outcome (if used), final_lift.
Concentration check: Print percentage of budget in top N channels from optimized_allocation.
Reasoning: Essential for debugging and verifying that the integrated logic behaves identically to the standalone script.
Next Steps:

I recommend the Replit AI Agent proceeds by:

Carefully backing up the current MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.
Systematically applying the changes outlined above, focusing on one section at a time (e.g., helper functions first, then scaling, then the main loop, then lift).
After each significant change or at the end, run the script with the Model ID 14 parameters (initial budget $201,785, desired budget $300,000, and then same budget $201,785) and compare the detailed logs and final JSON output against the known good results from budget_optimizer_fix.py.
