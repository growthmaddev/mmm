Agent, thank you for your continued efforts. The user is correct that the current results from the Budget Optimizer (0.0% decrease in lift, high budget concentration) do not match the more promising results you achieved in your isolated test scripts. This indicates the successful logic from those test scripts is still not fully operational in the live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.

To help us fix this definitively, please provide the following by accessing the files in the MarketMixMaster directory:

Show Core Logic from Current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

"From the current version of MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py (the one that produced the '0.0% decrease' lift), please extract and show the code for:
a. The function that calculates the sales contribution for a single channel (which takes spend, beta, adstock, and saturation parameters).
b. The function or section that calculates the total predicted outcome (for both initial and optimized allocations, showing how channel contributions are summed and how baseline_sales/intercept is added).
c. The main iterative budget allocation loop (showing how marginal ROI is used).
d. The function or section that calculates the lift percentage."
Show Corresponding Core Logic from Your Most Successful Test Script:

"Now, from your most successful standalone test script (this might be MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_best.py, MarketMixMaster/test_optimizer.py, or MarketMixMaster/budget_optimizer_fix.py â€“ whichever one produced results like +27% to +45% lift with ~57% budget concentration), please extract and show the equivalent code sections (a, b, c, d as listed above)."
Provide Detailed Log Output (Again, from the current problematic run):

"If you haven't already, please re-run Scenario B (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14 parameters) using the current live MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py by triggering it from the UI."
"Provide the complete server-side log output from this run, clearly showing:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each marketing channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, the key parameters used (beta, L, k, x0, adstock), its calculated sales contribution (initial and optimized).
The total predicted outcomes (initial and optimized).
The lift calculation."
By comparing these code sections side-by-side and looking at the detailed logs from the current live script, we (you, me, and the user) should be able to identify exactly where the logic in optimize_budget_marginal.py deviates from the successful test script or where it's still flawed. This will allow for very targeted corrections.

Let's start by getting these code snippets and the logs. This direct comparison is key
