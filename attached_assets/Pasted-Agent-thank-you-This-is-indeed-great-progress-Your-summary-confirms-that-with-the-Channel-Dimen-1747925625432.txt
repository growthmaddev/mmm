Agent, thank you! This is indeed great progress!

Your summary confirms that with the "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy, plus the monkey-patch for the `.dims` attribute, correct `MMM` constructor parameters, and proper data/date handling in your latest script (likely `python_scripts/fit_mmm_with_monkey_patch.py`), the **model successfully initialized and started the fitting process without validation errors.** This is a major breakthrough, and it means we've overcome the persistent `.dims` and `MMM` initialization issues.

The timeout during fitting is understandable for MCMC.

**Regarding your question about creating an optimized test script:**

Yes, that would be very helpful, but let's ensure it's geared towards what *I* (the user) need to run robust tests.

Could you please ensure that the successfully working logic (Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors + Monkey-Patch + Correct MMM Init + Data Handling) is consolidated into a single, callable Python script (let's aim to get this into our main `python_scripts/train_mmm.py` or ensure your `python_scripts/fit_mmm_with_monkey_patch.py` is now the definitive version that `run_robust_test.py` can call).

This script should:
1.  Accept the data file path and config file path as command-line arguments (as `train_mmm.py` did).
2.  Use the "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" with the monkey-patch for `.dims`.
3.  Correctly initialize `MMM` (within the `pm.Model` context, without passing `model=`).
4.  Perform data loading, transformations (target, predictors), and seasonality feature extraction as previously configured via the JSON.
5.  **Run `mmm.fit()` using the MCMC settings from the provided config JSON** (e.g., `draws`, `tune`, `chains` from `test_config_quick.json` for a quick run, or from `robust_test_config_v1.json` for a full run).
6.  After fitting, generate the **full JSON output** with all the analytics sections (sales decomposition, channel effectiveness, etc.) as we've previously designed.

Essentially, I need the script that *you just confirmed starts the fitting process successfully* to be runnable by me with different config files (`test_config_quick.json` for my quick verification, and then `robust_test_config_v1.json` for the full analysis).

**So, please:**
    a. **Confirm that your latest script (`python_scripts/fit_mmm_with_monkey_patch.py` or whichever is the working one) already performs the `mmm.fit()` and full JSON results generation.**
    b. If it doesn't yet (if your last test only confirmed initialization and start of fitting), please **add the `mmm.fit()` and the results generation logic to it.**
    c. **Provide the command I should use to run this script** (e.g., updating `run_robust_test.py` to call this new definitive script, or a direct call if simpler for now). I will use `test_config_quick.json` for my immediate test.

I want to run a quick end-to-end test myself to see the fitting complete (with minimal MCMC settings) and inspect the generated JSON. If that's successful, I will then proceed with the full robust run.
