Thank you for providing the latest version of MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. I've reviewed it, and it incorporates many elements from the "golden" script, including the scaling factor for contributions and the diversity adjustments.

Here's an analysis and a plan to address the remaining issues, particularly the "Same Budget" scenario behavior and the outcome/lift values:

Key Observations from the Provided Code:

"Same Budget" Scenario Handling (Lines ~274-307):

The script explicitly checks: if abs(desired_budget - current_total) < 0.01:.
If true, it bypasses the entire optimization loop and returns the current_allocation with expected_lift = 0.0. This is why you're seeing no changes for the "Same Budget" scenario.
Scaling Factors:

scaling_factor = 300.0 (in get_channel_response and calculate_marginal_return): This is correctly applied to individual channel responses/contributions to make them meaningful. This happens before baseline_sales is added.
outcome_scale = 5000 (near the end of optimize_budget function, line ~478): This factor is applied to the total expected_outcome and current_outcome after all other calculations (including baseline_sales addition and lift calculation) are done.
expected_outcome = baseline_sales + total_optimized_contribution (where contributions are already scaled by 300).
current_outcome = baseline_sales + total_current_contribution (contributions also scaled by 300).
percentage_lift is calculated using these expected_outcome and current_outcome values before the outcome_scale = 5000 is applied.
The final JSON returns expected_outcome * 5000, current_outcome * 5000, but the original percentage_lift. Mathematically, the lift percentage is the same, but it's important to be aware of which values were used for its calculation if debugging.
baseline_sales (Intercept):

The optimize_budget function accepts baseline_sales as a parameter.
However, in the main() function (lines ~525), baseline_sales = 0 is used as a default.
This is critical: If the input JSON passed from the Node.js controller does not contain a baseline_sales figure (or if that figure is 0), then the current_outcome and expected_outcome will only reflect the sum of scaled channel contributions. This would explain the very low outcome figures (like $185) you saw previously before the outcome_scale=5000 was applied at the end. Model ID 14 does have an intercept, and it should be a significant positive number.
logistic_saturation Function (Lines ~11-33):

The logic if exponent > 100: return 0.0 and elif exponent < -100: return L is correct for the standard logistic function L / (1 + exp(-k(x-x0))). This looks fine.
Diversity Adjustment (Lines ~351-368):

The logic diversity_adjustment = max(0.1, 1.0 - (channel_percentage * 2.0)) is implemented, which matches the improved formula.
Proposed Plan for the Replit AI Agent:

Modify "Same Budget" Scenario Logic:

Action: In optimize_budget function, remove or comment out the entire block from line ~275 to ~307:
Python

# current_total = sum(current_allocation.values()) # This line can also be removed or commented
# if abs(desired_budget - current_total) < 0.01:
#     if debug:
#         print(f"DEBUG: Desired budget matches current budget exactly, returning current allocation", file=sys.stderr)

#     # Calculate expected outcome and lift
#     expected_outcome = current_outcome
#     expected_lift = 0.0

#     result = {
#         "optimized_allocation": current_allocation,
#         "expected_outcome": expected_outcome,
#         "expected_lift": expected_lift,
#         "current_outcome": current_outcome,
#         "channel_breakdown": [] # This would also need more careful construction if we kept this block
#     }
#     # ... rest of the block ...
#     return result
Reasoning: This will allow the optimization loop (starting from line ~326) to run even when the current and desired budgets are the same. The optimizer will then attempt to reallocate funds from less effective to more effective channels to maximize the outcome for the given budget. If the initial allocation is already optimal, it will naturally result in 0% lift.
Verify baseline_sales Input:

Action (for the Replit AI Agent to check with you/the setup):
Confirm that the JSON input file being passed to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py (as sys.argv[1]) by the server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts controller includes a baseline_sales key with the correct intercept value from Model ID 14.
If it's not being passed, modify server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts to include it in the JSON payload written to the temporary input file for the Python script. The train_mmm.py script should be saving this intercept value.
In python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, within the main() function, ensure baseline_sales is properly extracted from the input data dictionary. For example:
Python

# In main() function, around line 525
baseline_sales = data.get("baseline_sales", 0.0) # Ensure it's float
if baseline_sales == 0.0:
    print("DEBUG: WARNING - baseline_sales is 0. Check if it's correctly passed from model parameters.", file=sys.stderr)
Reasoning: A correct baseline_sales is fundamental for realistic current_outcome and expected_outcome values before the final outcome_scale of 5000. If baseline_sales is missing or zero, the outcomes will be drastically underestimated, leading to confusing lift percentages when compared to the displayed (and scaled by 5000) outcome numbers.
Test and Provide Detailed Logs:

After making the change for the "Same Budget" scenario and verifying baseline_sales input:
Action: Ask the Replit AI Agent to run both scenarios again:
Scenario 1: Current Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $201,785
Scenario 2: Current Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000
Action: For each scenario, instruct the agent to capture and provide the full stderr debug logs from the Python script. These logs are very detailed in the provided script and will show:
All input parameters received by optimize_budget (including baseline_sales, scaling_factor).
Initial contributions, total current contribution, and current_outcome (before the 5000x scaling).
For the "Same Budget" scenario, logs from the optimization loop (marginal returns, diversity adjustments, chosen channels) to see if it's attempting to reallocate.
Optimized contributions, total optimized contribution, and expected_outcome (before the 5000x scaling).
The calculated percentage_lift (before 5000x outcome scaling).
The final JSON output string.
Action: Also, please get screenshots of the UI for both scenarios after these changes.
Summary of Expected Improvements:

The "Same Budget" scenario should now run the optimizer and potentially suggest a different, better allocation (or confirm the current one is optimal).
With a correct baseline_sales value, the current_outcome and expected_outcome calculated within the Python script (before the final 5000x scaling) should be much more realistic.
The percentage_lift will be based on these more realistic unscaled outcomes.
The final outcomes displayed in the UI (after the 5000x scaling) should also appear more sensible and in the "millions" range if baseline_sales is appropriate.
Let's proceed with these steps. The most impactful changes will likely be removing the "Same Budget" bypass and ensuring baseline_sales is correctly injected and used
