Okay, I'm on board to help relay and refine instructions for the Replit AI Agent. It's clear there's been a lot of detailed troubleshooting!

This "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy seems like a promising way to tackle the persistent .dims attribute error, especially given the Pydantic validation issue that prevents passing the model= argument directly to the MMM constructor in pymc-marketing==0.13.1.



Here's a detailed prompt you can provide to the Replit AI Agent:
Hello Replit AI Agent,

We've made significant progress in understanding the interaction between our fixed parameter requirements, PyMC v5, and pymc-marketing==0.13.1. Key recent findings include:

The MMM() constructor in pymc-marketing==0.13.1 will not accept a model= argument due to its Pydantic validation layer, resulting in an "Unexpected keyword argument" error.


Simply defining named scalar Random Variables within a with pm.Model(): block and then instantiating MMM() in the same block (relying on implicit context) unfortunately still leads to the AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute 'dims'.

To address this, we will now implement the "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy. This approach aims to make the dimension information directly part of the prior objects that MMM inspects.

Your task is to modify the Python script python_scripts/mmm_named_rvs.py (and its primary function, e.g., train_mmm_with_named_rvs or similar, that sets up and runs the MMM) as follows:

Establish a Single pm.Model() Context with Channel Coordinates:

At the beginning of your MMM setup function, get the list of channel names from the configuration.
Create a pm.Model instance, defining "channel" as a coordinate using this list of names. All subsequent PyMC object definitions and the MMM instantiation must occur inside this with block.
Python

# Example:
# channel_names_list = list(config['channelColumns'].keys()) # Or however you get your ordered list of channel names
# with pm.Model(coords={"channel": channel_names_list}) as mmm_model_context:
    # ... all definitions below go here ...


Prepare NumPy Arrays for Fixed Parameter Values (per channel):

Inside the with mmm_model_context: block:
For each fixed parameter (alpha for adstock; L, k, x0 for saturation), create an ordered NumPy array. Each array should contain the specific fixed value for each channel, corresponding to the order in channel_names_list.

Retrieve these values from your config object (e.g., config['adstockSettings'], config['saturationSettings']), carefully handling default values and channel-specific overrides to ensure the correct value is assigned to each channel in the array.
Python

# Example for alpha_values (adapt your config access logic):
# alpha_values = np.array([
#     config['adstockSettings']['channel_specific_params'].get(ch, config['adstockSettings']['default'])['adstock_alpha']
#     for ch in channel_names_list
# ])
# # Create similar L_values, k_values, x0_values NumPy arrays
Global l_max for Adstock: Since l_max for GeometricAdstock is an integer parameter and not an RV prior, and this strategy uses a global adstock object, determine a single global_l_max value. This could be the maximum l_max found across all channel configurations or a suitable default.
Python

# Example:
# l_max_config_values = [
#     config['adstockSettings']['channel_specific_params'].get(ch, config['adstockSettings']['default'])['adstock_l_max']
#     for ch in channel_names_list
# ]
# global_l_max = int(max(l_max_config_values))
# print(f"DEBUG: Using global l_max for Adstock: {global_l_max}", file=sys.stderr)


Define Channel-Dimensioned "Fixed" Priors as Named Random Variables (RVs):

Still inside the with mmm_model_context: block:
For each parameter type (alpha, L, k, x0), create a single named PyMC Random Variable (e.g., using pm.Normal to simulate a fixed point with a very small sigma, or pm.DiracDelta if you confirm it works with the .dims monkey-patch for logp stage as discussed previously – let’s stick to pm.Normal with tiny sigma for now as per the reference instructions).
The mu for these RVs will be the NumPy arrays created in step 2.
Crucially, specify dims="channel" when defining these RVs.
Python

# Example:
# Ensure alpha_values, L_values, k_values, x0_values are defined as NumPy arrays
# alpha_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_alphas_per_channel", mu=alpha_values, sigma=1e-6, dims="channel")
# L_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_Ls_per_channel", mu=L_values, sigma=1e-6, dims="channel")

# For k and x0, ensure sigma is an array if mu is an array, or a small positive scalar.
# Consider that k can be negative.
# k_sigma_values = np.maximum(np.abs(k_values * 0.001), 1e-7) # Example if k_values is an array
# x0_sigma_values = np.maximum(np.abs(x0_values * 0.001), 1e-2) # Example if x0_values is an array

# k_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_ks_per_channel", mu=k_values, sigma=k_sigma_values, dims="channel")
# x0_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_x0s_per_channel", mu=x0_values, sigma=x0_sigma_values, dims="channel")


Apply the .dims monkey-patch: After creating each of these RVs, apply the monkey patch to ensure the .dims attribute is explicitly set, e.g., alpha_rv_chan.dims = ("channel",). This was key to solving previous initialization errors.
Create GLOBAL Adstock and Saturation Transformation Objects:

Still inside the with mmm_model_context: block:
Instantiate a single, global GeometricAdstock object and a single, global LogisticSaturation object.
Pass the channel-dimensioned RVs (created in step 3) into the priors dictionary for these global transformation objects. Use the global_l_max for the GeometricAdstock.
Python

# Example:
# global_adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=global_l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha_rv_chan})
# global_saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L_rv_chan, "k": k_rv_chan, "x0": x0_rv_chan})


Instantiate the MMM Object with Global Transforms:

Still inside the with mmm_model_context: block:
Instantiate your pymc_marketing.MMM object.
Pass the channel_names_list to channel_columns.
Pass the global_adstock_obj to the adstock argument and global_saturation_obj to the saturation argument.

Crucially, do NOT pass the model= argument. The MMM object will implicitly use mmm_model_context because it's being instantiated within that context.

With this global, channel-dimensioned approach, you should NOT need to manually set or modify mmm.media_transforms after instantiation.
Python

# Example:
# mmm = MMM(
#     date_column=your_date_column_name,
#     channel_columns=channel_names_list,
#     control_columns=your_control_columns_list, # Ensure this is correctly defined
#     adstock=global_adstock_obj,
#     saturation=global_saturation_obj
#     # NO model= argument here
# )


(Optional but Recommended) Debug Random Variable Dimensions:

Before instantiating MMM, you might want to include a small debug helper function (like debug_distribution_dims mentioned in previous logs if you have it) or simply print the .dims attribute of alpha_rv_chan, L_rv_chan, etc., to sys.stderr to confirm they are indeed ("channel",) after definition and monkey-patching.

Deliverables:

A.  Please show me the key sections of the updated python_scripts/mmm_named_rvs.py (specifically the main MMM setup function) that reflect these changes.
B.  After implementing the changes, please run your test script (test_run_mmm_named_rvs.py) using the test_config_quick.json configuration.
C.  Provide the full console output from this test run, including any DEBUG print statements.

This "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy directly aims to satisfy the if dist.dims != ("channel",): check within pymc-marketing by ensuring the passed distribution objects inherently carry the correct channel dimension information. This is a more fundamental approach than trying to assign per-channel transforms later. We understand this involves a compromise of using a global l_max.



Good luck! We're keen to see if this resolves the .dims error and allows the model to proceed to fitting.
