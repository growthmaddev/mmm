Hi Agent,

Thank you for the detailed explanation of the recent improvements to `train_mmm.py`.

1.  **Channel Spend:** We acknowledge the fix for displaying channel spend. Please ensure that the `analytics.channel_effectiveness_detail[channelName].spend` field (or a similarly named dedicated field for actual total spend per channel) is now the reliable primary source for this data from `train_mmm.py`. We will aim to simplify frontend fallbacks later if this proves robust.

2.  **Model-Derived Contributions:** Your new layered approach for calculating channel contributions is a significant improvement. This will provide more accurate insights.

3.  **Intercept Scaling (Needs Revision):**
    * Your current "intelligent intercept scaling" aims to fix the low baseline issue by adjusting the intercept so the total baseline targets ~20% of total sales if the learned baseline is very low.
    * **This heuristic of targeting an arbitrary 20% must be revised.** While we want to address the issue of an extremely low baseline, the `actual_model_intercept` reported in `train_mmm.py`'s output (and used for `baseline_sales` in the optimizer) **must reflect the model's *actual learned intercept*, simply scaled from a per-period value to cover the total duration of the data** (i.e., `raw_learned_intercept * len(df)`).
    * **Please modify `train_mmm.py` to:**
        * Ensure that `results["summary"]["actual_model_intercept"]` stores the model's genuinely learned intercept, scaled by `len(df)` to represent the total baseline over the data period. **Do not adjust it to meet a heuristic target like 20% of total sales.**
        * **Keep the valuable warning mechanism:** If this correctly scaled, model-learned `total_baseline_sales` is still very low (e.g., <1% of `sum(y)` as you implemented), the script should absolutely still print the detailed warning to stderr to alert the user that the model has learned an unusually low baseline, which might indicate data or model specification issues. This warning is crucial for diagnostics.
        * If the `extract_model_intercept` function cannot find any intercept and returns `None`, the fallback you mentioned (e.g., defaulting `total_baseline_sales` to a clearly indicated heuristic like 20% of total sales, *and very loudly warning that no intercept was found and a heuristic is being used*) could be a temporary last resort to prevent crashes, but the primary path must use the scaled learned intercept.

The goal is transparency and reflecting the true model output. If the true model output indicates a problem (like a very low intercept or R-squared), we need to see that clearly so we can address the root cause in the data or model specification, rather than altering the output to appear more "reasonable."

Once these revisions to intercept handling are made, please provide the updated `train_mmm.py` snippet showing how `total_baseline_sales` and `results["summary"]["actual_model_intercept"]` are now calculated and finalized.
