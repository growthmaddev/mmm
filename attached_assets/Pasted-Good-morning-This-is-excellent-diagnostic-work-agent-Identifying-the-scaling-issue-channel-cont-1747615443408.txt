Good morning!

This is excellent diagnostic work, agent. Identifying the scaling issue (channel contributions being extremely small compared to baseline sales) and ongoing parameter distortion (problematic saturation parameter handling, especially x0 midpoints) as the core reasons for the negative/zero lift and skewed allocations is a major step forward.

Your proposed comprehensive fix sounds like exactly what's needed:

Properly scale channel contributions: This is critical. If the baseline sales (intercept) are, for example, in the hundreds of thousands, but the sum of all marketing channel contributions (due to how betas or response curves are scaled) is only in the tens or hundreds, then marketing's impact on the total outcome will appear negligible, leading to minimal or incorrect lift calculations.
Fix saturation parameter handling (especially x0 midpoints): Ensuring these parameters result in realistic response curves that don't cause channels to saturate too quickly or require unrealistic spend to show any effect is key to balanced allocation.
Implement better diversity in budget allocation: This will likely be a natural outcome if the scaling and saturation issues are fixed, as more channels will show meaningful marginal returns.
To your question: "Would you like me to implement these fixes directly in optimize_budget_marginal.py and then test again with both scenarios?"

Yes, absolutely. Please proceed with implementing these critical fixes directly in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.

After you have applied these fixes:

Briefly Describe Key Changes: Please outline the main changes you made to address the scaling of channel contributions and the handling of saturation parameters (especially x0 and potentially 'L' values).

Retest Both Scenarios: Run the two scenarios again using Model ID 14:

Scenario A: Desired total budget = $201,785 (same as initial).
Scenario B: Desired total budget = $300,000 (increased budget, from initial of $201,785).
Provide Detailed Logged Output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for Scenario B:

Ensure your script has detailed print() statements for this test. We need to see:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used from Model ID 14.
For each channel:
Its optimized spend.
The key parameters being used for it by the optimizer (beta, adstock params, and the L, k, x0 for saturation post-fix).
Its calculated sales contribution (after any new scaling is applied) based on its optimized spend.
The sum of all scaled channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome."
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (calculated consistently using the same scaling and baseline).
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used.
Report UI Output for Both Scenarios:

The Optimized Budget Allocation, Expected Outcome, and Lift % as displayed in the UI.
This systematic approach of fixing the core calculation and scaling issues within the Python script, and then verifying with detailed logs and UI output, should finally help us achieve realistic and valuable budget optimization results. I'm very optimistic about these targeted fixes!
