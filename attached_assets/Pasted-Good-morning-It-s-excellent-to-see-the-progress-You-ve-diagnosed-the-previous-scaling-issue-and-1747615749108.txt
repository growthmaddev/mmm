Good morning!

It's excellent to see the progress:

You've diagnosed the previous scaling issue, and now the channel contributions are showing meaningful values (like $21,823 for PPCBrand and $7,188 for PPCPMax) with corresponding ROIs. This is a very significant step forward!
You've also correctly identified the two remaining critical issues:
Negative lift percentage (-45%) with the increased budget scenario. This is the most pressing problem to solve.
Poor budget allocation diversity (still concentrating on a few channels).
You were about to "create a more direct fix for both the lift calculation and diversity issues by creating a fixed_saturation.py script that demonstrates exactly what needs to be corrected."

Please proceed with that approach if you feel it helps isolate the logic, or directly implement the fixes in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. The absolute priority is to fix the negative lift calculation.

Hereâ€™s what to focus on to resolve the negative lift:

Consistent Total Outcome Calculation (Most Likely Cause of Negative Lift):

When calculating the predicted_initial_outcome (for the budget before optimization), ensure it is: Sum of (contributions of each channel at initial spend, using the corrected response curves) + baseline_sales (intercept from Model ID 14)
When calculating the predicted_optimized_outcome (for the budget after optimization), ensure it is: Sum of (contributions of each channel at optimized spend, using the corrected response curves) + baseline_sales (intercept from Model ID 14)
The baseline_sales (intercept) must be the same value and must be added consistently to both calculations. If it's missing from one, or if the channel contribution calculation methods differ fundamentally between these two states, the lift will be incorrect.
Lift Formula:

Ensure lift is ((predicted_optimized_outcome / predicted_initial_outcome) - 1) * 100.
Once you believe you have applied fixes to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py to address the lift calculation (and potentially made initial improvements for diversity):

Briefly describe the core changes you made, especially regarding how predicted_initial_outcome and predicted_optimized_outcome are now calculated and how the baseline_sales is incorporated.

Then, please run our standard test Scenario B again (using Model ID 14, initial budget $201,785, desired budget $300,000).

Provide the detailed logged output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for this run. This log must clearly show:

The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each channel: its initial spend, its optimized spend, its calculated sales contribution for the initial spend, and its calculated sales contribution for the optimized spend.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (sum of initial contributions + baseline_sales).
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (sum of optimized contributions + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome."
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used.
Finally, show the UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation, Expected Outcome, Lift %) for this test run.

Let's get that lift calculation showing a positive, sensible value when the budget is increased and intelligently reallocated!
