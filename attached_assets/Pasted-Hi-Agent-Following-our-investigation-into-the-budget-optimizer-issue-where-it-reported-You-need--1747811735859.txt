Hi Agent,

Following our investigation into the budget optimizer issue (where it reported "You need a completed model..."), we've identified the root cause: the `actual_model_intercept` value being saved in the main model results is extremely low (e.g., 0.403). This is causing the `budgetOptimization.ts` controller to effectively use a zero baseline, leading to skewed optimization results.

Our priority is to ensure the application works robustly with **actual data and parameters derived directly from the PyMC model training process**. The fixes below are intended to correctly process and utilize the model's true intercept.

**Please implement the following fixes:**

**1. In `train_mmm.py`:**

    a.  **Correctly Scale `actual_model_intercept` for Main Results:**
        * The `actual_model_intercept` field stored in the main `results["summary"]` dictionary must represent the **total baseline sales** over the entire period of the input data, derived from the model's intercept.
        * The `extract_model_intercept` function fetches the per-period intercept. Ensure that the `results["summary"]["actual_model_intercept"]` field is populated with this value correctly scaled to represent the total baseline (i.e., `intercept_value * len(df)`), similar to how it's done for the `analytics.sales_decomposition.base_sales` field. This ensures the optimizer uses a value reflecting the full scope of the model.

    b.  **Add Validation and Warning for Scaled `actual_model_intercept` (within `train_mmm.py`):**
        * After the scaling in step 1a, add a validation check.
        * If this scaled `actual_model_intercept` (which represents total baseline sales) is still exceptionally low relative to the overall scale of the target variable (e.g., less than 1% of the sum of `y` (target_column values), but not zero if `y` itself is not zero), print a clear warning to stderr. This warning should highlight a potential issue with the model's fit or data characteristics that might lead to an unusually low baseline, even after correct scaling.
        * The script must still output the calculated and scaled `actual_model_intercept` (even if a warning is issued) to ensure the data pipeline is transparent. We are not substituting dummy data here, but ensuring the real calculated value is used and flagged if anomalous.

**2. In `budgetOptimization.ts` (around lines 224-244 or where `actual_model_intercept` is read):**

    a.  **Refine Sanity Check for `baseline_sales`:**
        * The existing logic defaults `baseline_sales` to `0.0` if `actual_model_intercept` is missing.
        * Modify this: If the `actual_model_intercept` (which should now be the correctly scaled total baseline from `train_mmm.py`) is missing, OR if it's present but still critically low (e.g., less than a small, sensible absolute value like 1.0, or zero when total sales/spend is clearly much higher), the existing critical error/warning console messages should be logged.
        * The goal is to ensure the budget optimizer either receives a meaningful, scaled baseline from the model or, in genuinely problematic cases, makes it clear that the baseline is too low for reliable optimization, rather than silently proceeding with a near-zero baseline. For now, if it's critically low/missing after the fix in `train_mmm.py`, maintain the behavior of defaulting to 0.0 but ensure the console warnings clearly state the implications.

**Testing and Deliverables:**

* After implementing these changes, re-run the training for a model.
* **Crucially, verify that the `actual_model_intercept` in the `results.summary.actual_model_intercept` JSON output is the correctly scaled total baseline sales figure derived from the model.**
* Confirm that the budget optimizer (`/projects/31/budget-optimizer?model=24` or equivalent) can now be accessed and operates with this corrected, realistic baseline sales figure. The optimization results should reflect this more sensible baseline.
* Provide the updated `train_mmm.py` and `budgetOptimization.ts` files.
* Summarize your testing, explicitly confirming the source and calculation of the `actual_model_intercept` now used by the optimizer, and confirm the resolution of the original bug.

This approach prioritizes fixing the pipeline to use real, correctly processed model outputs.
