Hi Agent,

Thank you for fetching the initial metrics for model 26. The continued extremely low baseline (36.11 total, 0.0001% of sales), even with improved MCMC settings, is a strong indicator of more fundamental issues with the data or model specification in `train_mmm.py`.

**Task 1: Retrieve Complete R-squared and RMSE for Model 26**

While you inferred R-squared is low and RMSE was not visible in the log snippet, the `train_mmm.py` script calculates these and includes them in its main JSON output.
* Please try to access the **full stored JSON results for model 26** (not just log snippets).
* From these full results, extract and report the exact:
    1.  **R-squared value** (calculated from `model_results.model_accuracy / 100`).
    2.  **RMSE value** (from `model_results.summary.fit_metrics.rmse`).

**Task 2: Propose Diagnostic Steps and Potential Changes for `train_mmm.py`**

Yes, please suggest changes to help diagnose and address the persistent low baseline and poor model fit. Your suggestions should focus on investigating and potentially modifying `train_mmm.py`, considering areas such as:

1.  **Data Preprocessing (`load_data` function in `train_mmm.py`):**
    * Could any current preprocessing steps (e.g., `fillna(0)` for all numeric columns, date parsing, lack of scaling for predictors or target) be negatively impacting model fit or intercept estimation?
    * Should we consider scaling/normalizing the input spend data or the target variable?

2.  **Model Specification (`train_model` function in `train_mmm.py`):**
    * **Priors:** The model currently uses default priors from PyMC-Marketing. Could these be problematic for this specific dataset, especially for the intercept term? (This might be an advanced topic, but worth noting if it's a common cause for such issues).
    * **Transformations:** Are the current adstock (`GeometricAdstock`) and saturation (`LogisticSaturation`) settings and their parameters (either default or learned) appropriate? Is the model often falling back to default parameters for these, and do those defaults make sense for the scale of the data?
    * **Control Variables:** The `config` allows for `controlVariables`. If no significant control variables (e.g., promotions, holidays, competitor actions, other non-media drivers) are being included, could their omission lead to a poorly specified model and an unreliable intercept?
    * **Model-Derived Contributions:** You recently updated this logic. Is it possible that the way contributions are derived or constrained within the model could be influencing the intercept?

3.  **Target Variable (`y` in `train_mmm.py`):**
    * What are the characteristics of the target variable (e.g., `Sales`)? Is it highly skewed, does it have many zero values, or strong underlying trends that aren't being captured?

Please provide your suggestions for diagnostic steps or modifications to `train_mmm.py` to address these potential areas. We need to understand why the model is struggling to fit the "real client data."
