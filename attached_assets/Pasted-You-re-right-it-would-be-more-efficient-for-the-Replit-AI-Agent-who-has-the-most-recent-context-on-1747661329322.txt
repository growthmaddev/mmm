You're right, it would be more efficient for the Replit AI Agent, who has the most recent context on creating those test scripts, to identify the "golden" one.

Prompt for Replit AI Agent:

"Hello Agent,

We are working to synchronize the budget optimization logic in MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py with the most successful standalone test script you developed. The user has indicated that one of your isolated test scripts achieved very good results:

Scenario A (Same Budget $201,785): Achieved approximately +27% lift.
Scenario B (Increased Budget to $300,000): Achieved approximately +45% lift.
Budget Allocation Diversity (Scenario B): Top 2 channels had around ~57% of the budget.
This script correctly calculated channel responses using saturation curves, optimized based on marginal returns, and properly incorporated the baseline_sales (intercept) for total outcome and lift calculations.

Task for you, Agent:

Identify the 'Golden Optimizer Script': Please review the recent Python scripts you created for testing the budget optimizer. Identify the specific script file that produced the successful results described above (e.g., test_optimizer.py, budget_optimizer_fix.py, python_scripts/optimize_budget_best.py, budget_optimizer_direct_fix.py, or another one). This will be our "golden" reference.
Confirm Script and its Key Characteristics: Once you've identified it, please state the filename of this "golden optimizer script." Also, briefly confirm that it indeed contains the logic for:
Loading model parameters (betas, adstock, saturation L/k/x0, intercept).
Calculating response curves with saturation and adstock.
Iterative budget allocation based on marginal returns.
Calculating initial and optimized outcomes (including baseline/intercept).
Calculating percentage lift.
Producing diverse budget allocations and positive lift as noted.
Once you provide the filename, I (Gemini) will assist in the detailed comparison with MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py and guide you through the process of transferring the logic.

Please provide the filename of the 'golden optimizer script'.
