Agent, thank you for the updates on your fixes to train_mmm.py and ChannelImpactContent.tsx.

However, based on the user's latest feedback after training a new model, the 'Channel Impact' tab is still showing critical issues: 'No time series data available,' 'No response curve data available,' and the contribution table has $0 spend and 0.00x ROI.

This indicates that the complete and correctly structured detailed data is still not being generated by python_scripts/train_mmm.py for this new model and/or not being successfully passed through the API to the frontend components.

Before we discuss any further improvements to the 'Channel Impact' tab (like refining percentage distinctions) or move to the 'Technical Details' tab, we must resolve this fundamental data flow issue.

Your immediate and critical next step is:

Verify the JSON Output of the LATEST train_mmm.py for the NEWLY Trained Model:

Action: Please locate and examine the actual JSON output file that was generated by the current version of python_scripts/train_mmm.py for the model the user just trained (the one showing the UI issues).
Provide a substantial snippet of this JSON output. We need to meticulously verify if the following key sections are present, correctly structured, AND populated with actual numerical data (not empty arrays, empty objects, or just placeholder/fallback values that result in $0 spend/ROI):
time_series_decomposition: With populated dates, baseline series, control_variables (with series for each control, if any), and marketing_channels (with series for each channel from idata).
channel_parameters / response_curves_data: With fitted beta, L, k, x0, and adstock parameters for each channel, or the data points for the curves.
total_contributions_summary: With aggregated totals for baseline, control_variables, marketing_channels, total_marketing_contribution, and overall_total_predicted_outcome.
historical_channel_spends: This is essential. It must contain an object/dictionary mapping each channel to its non-zero total historical spend. The $0 spend and ROI in the UI strongly suggest this part is missing or empty in the data reaching the frontend.
If the JSON Output is Incomplete/Incorrect:

Action: You must go back to python_scripts/train_mmm.py and ensure it correctly calculates, extracts from the PyMC-Marketing idata object, and saves ALL these required fields. Focus on making the primary data extraction from idata work reliably. Fallbacks should be a last resort and clearly logged if used. Critically, ensure historical_channel_spends are included.
Re-run training for a quick test model (or the new model again if the fix is targeted) with the corrected train_mmm.py.
Provide the new, verified JSON snippet. Repeat this until the JSON is demonstrably complete and correct.
THEN, (and only after the JSON from train_mmm.py is confirmed correct):

Verify the API endpoint in server/controllers/models.ts is serving this complete JSON.
Verify client/src/components/charts/ChannelImpactContent.tsx is correctly parsing this JSON, especially the paths to historical_channel_spends and the detailed arrays for time-series and response curves.
Let's solve the data generation and pipeline issue first. The UI is accurately telling us that the data it needs isn't arriving. Please start by showing the JSON output from the most recent model training run.
