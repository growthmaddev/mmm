Agent, thank you for running the optimization. The user's observations are critical. An 'Expected Outcome' of $2 and zeroing out so many channels, including OfflineMedia, indicates we need to debug python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py more deeply.

Please focus on the following within optimize_budget_marginal.py:

Verify Total Predicted Outcome Calculation (Highest Priority):

"Show me the exact code in optimize_budget_marginal.py that calculates the predicted_optimized_outcome.
Critically, ensure it is correctly incorporating the model's intercept (baseline sales) from Model ID 14's parameters. This intercept value should be added to the sum of contributions from all channels.
Add logging within the Python script to output:
The baseline sales (intercept value) being used.
The predicted contribution from each individual channel at its optimized spend level.
The final summed predicted_optimized_outcome."
Inspect Saturation Parameters and Response Curves:

"Please retrieve and show the fitted saturation parameters (L, k, x0 for LogisticSaturation) and beta coefficients for ALL channels from Model ID 14's stored results JSON.
Looking at these parameters, do some channels have extremely low 'L' values (maximum potential sales from the channel) or other parameters that would cause them to saturate almost immediately or contribute very little?"
Log Marginal ROI Calculations (If Feasible):

"If possible, add logging to optimize_budget_marginal.py to show, for a few iterations or key decision points, the calculated marginal ROIs for a few of the key channels (e.g., OfflineMedia, PPCBrand, and one of the channels that got zeroed out). This will help us understand why the algorithm is making such drastic allocation decisions."
Check Units and Scaling:

"Double-check that all spend figures (current allocation, desired budget) passed to the Python script, and the parameters used within it (coefficients, saturation parameters), are on a consistent scale. A mismatch here could lead to very small outcome predictions."
Let's start by thoroughly debugging the predicted_optimized_outcome calculation, especially the inclusion of the baseline/intercept, and by examining the actual fitted saturation parameters for all channels from Model ID 14. This will likely reveal the cause of the unexpectedly low outcome and the extreme budget shifts."

Once we understand why the current optimization is producing these results, we can then reliably implement the budget constraint feature you asked for.
