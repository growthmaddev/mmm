his is truly excellent! The successful model run with improved MCMC parameters (draws=200, tune=100, chains=2) and the dramatic jump in R-squared to 91.36% is a fantastic achievement. It confirms:

The end-to-end PyMC-Marketing integration is working reliably.
The system can handle model runs of a few minutes (3 min 14 sec).
Increasing MCMC parameters leads to a much better model fit, as expected.
The UI is correctly displaying these new, real results.
The MCMC diagnostic warnings are providing clear guidance for further improvements.
You've successfully moved from a technically working pipeline to one that's starting to produce statistically meaningful (though still preliminary and on a small dataset) results!

Now, to your question: "Would you like me to make any of these improvements to the model configuration for further testing?"
The improvements you listed were:

Using more chains (4+ as recommended)
Increasing max_treedepth and target_accept
Further increasing draws and tune parameters
Using more data (beyond 100 rows) for training
Given this success, the next most impactful step is to run the model with more data, as this is a fundamental requirement for robust MMM. We should also incorporate the advice about using more chains.

Hereâ€™s the plan:

Increase Dataset Size:

The current test used a 100-row subset. We need to understand the size of the full test_data.csv.
Action for you (Replit AI Agent): In python_scripts/train_mmm.py, please modify the data loading logic. Instead of using only 100 rows, let's aim for a more substantial dataset for this next run.
First, can you tell me how many total rows (time periods) are in the original test_data.csv file?
Based on that, if the full dataset is, for example, between 150-250 rows (which often represents 3-5 years of weekly data), let's try using the full test_data.csv.
If the full test_data.csv is significantly larger (e.g., 500+ rows), let's start by using the first 156 rows (which would typically represent 3 years of weekly data).
The goal is to use a more realistic amount of historical data that allows the model to better capture trends, seasonality, and lagged effects.
Adjust MCMC Parameters for the Run with More Data:

For this run with increased data, please set the following MCMC parameters in python_scripts/train_mmm.py:
chains = 4 (as per the diagnostic recommendation from the previous run, for better convergence diagnostics).
tune = 500 (increasing from 100, to give more adaptation time, especially with more data and chains).
draws = 1000 (increasing from 200, to aim for better ESS and more stable estimates).
Keep cores = 1 (unless you are confident Replit can handle parallel chains easily, then cores = 4 could be attempted).
Leave target_accept and max_treedepth at their PyMC defaults for now. We can address these if the MCMC diagnostics from this new run still strongly indicate issues there.
Initiate a New Model Training Run:

Once python_scripts/train_mmm.py is updated with the larger dataset and these new MCMC parameters (chains=4, tune=500, draws=1000), please trigger a new model training run from the frontend UI.
Monitor and Report Back:

This run will likely take considerably longer than the previous 3-minute run due to both more data and increased MCMC settings. Please monitor its progress.
When it completes (or if it runs for a very extended period, say over 20-30 minutes, and hasn't finished, let me know), please report back on:
Total execution time.
The new R-squared value.
Key channel ROI values.
All MCMC diagnostic warnings provided by PyMC/ArviZ (e.g.,  
R
^
 , ESS, divergences, tree depth warnings).
Confirmation that the new results were successfully stored in the database and that the UI updated to reflect them.
This next run will be a crucial test of the system's ability to handle more realistic MMM workloads and will give us much better insight into the model's performance on a more appropriate dataset. Given the current time (late Sunday night here in Perth), this is likely a task whose results we'll review in our next interaction.

Please proceed with determining the full size of test_data.csv and then updating train_mmm.py as outlined. You can then kick off the new training run. I look forward to seeing the results!
