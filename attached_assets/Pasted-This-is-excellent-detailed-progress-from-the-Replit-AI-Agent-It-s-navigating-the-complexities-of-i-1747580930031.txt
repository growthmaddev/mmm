This is excellent, detailed progress from the Replit AI Agent! It's navigating the complexities of integrating the Python script, addressing timeouts by reducing dataset size and MCMC parameters, and now pinpointing a very specific API change or requirement in PyMC-Marketing. This iterative debugging is exactly what's needed.

Here's an analysis of the current situation and your next steps:

Key Progress & Current Status:

Proactive Optimization for Testing: The agent has successfully modified train_mmm.py to:
Automatically limit the dataset to 100 rows for faster testing.
Reduce MCMC parameters to an absolute minimum (draws=20, tune=10). This is understood to be for pipeline testing only, and the results will not be statistically valid, but it's crucial for getting a quick end-to-end run.
Improve error handling, logging, and status reporting within the Python script.
Backend Error Handling: The modelTraining.ts controller has also been enhanced to better manage errors from the Python script.
New Specific Issue Identified: The test run python3 python_scripts/train_mmm.py test_data.csv temp_config.json has revealed a clear error: "the PyMC-Marketing MMM class has changed its required parameters - it now needs both adstock and saturation parameters explicitly passed during initialization." This is a very concrete issue to solve.
Current Agent Focus: The agent is now correctly focused on fixing this API requirement in train_mmm.py.
Your Role and Next Instructions:

You are in a good position. The agent has a clear, specific task.

Encourage the Current Fix:

"Great job on pinpointing the exact issue with the PyMC-Marketing MMM class parameters! Please proceed with modifying train_mmm.py to ensure that adstock and saturation parameters are explicitly passed during the MMM class initialization, as required by the version of the library we are using.
Make sure these parameters are being correctly read from the temp_config.json (or the configuration object passed to the script) and then supplied to the MMM() or DelayedSaturatedMMM() class constructor."
Next Step After the Fix:

"Once you've made this change, please re-run the standalone test: python3 python_scripts/train_mmm.py test_data.csv temp_config.json
Let me know if this resolves the parameter initialization error and if the script runs to completion (even if very quickly with no meaningful statistical output due to the minimal settings) and produces the expected JSON output structure."
Reiterate the Goal: End-to-End Test from UI:

"Assuming the standalone Python script test is successful after this fix, the immediate next priority will be to conduct the full end-to-end test by triggering a model training session from the frontend UI.
We need to verify the entire pipeline: UI click -> Node.js controller (modelTraining.ts) -> train_mmm.py execution (with 100 rows, draws=20, tune=10) -> results/status back to Node.js -> database update -> UI status update and (eventually) display of placeholder/preliminary results.
During this end-to-end test, pay close attention to how the Node.js controller handles the output and any potential errors from the Python script now that it includes more detailed logging and error handling."
Important Note on MCMC Settings:

"Just to reiterate, the current MCMC settings (draws=20, tune=10) and dataset limit (100 rows) are strictly temporary for validating the pipeline's technical execution. Once this end-to-end flow is confirmed to be working without errors, our very next step will be to incrementally increase these settings (and the data volume) to find a balance that provides more meaningful (though still potentially 'development-grade') results within a reasonable time on Replit.
