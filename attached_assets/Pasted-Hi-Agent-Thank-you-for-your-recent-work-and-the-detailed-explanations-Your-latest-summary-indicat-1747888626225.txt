Hi Agent,

Thank you for your recent work and the detailed explanations. Your latest summary indicated:
    ✓ "The original model-learned intercept is now preserved without arbitrary adjustments"
    ✓ "Enhanced warning system clearly identifies low/high baseline issues without modifying values"
    ✓ "Only uses fallback heuristic as a last resort when no intercept is found"

This revised approach to intercept handling is what we need. We also have the initial metrics from model 26 (R-squared ~3.4%, RMSE ~69k, total baseline ~36.11), which highlight the importance of understanding our model's behavior.

Please proceed with the following ordered tasks:

**Task 1: Provide Final Confirmation of Intercept Logic in `train_mmm.py`**
    a.  To definitively confirm the intercept logic, please provide the **final Python code snippet(s)** from `train_mmm.py` that show:
        i.  How the raw `intercept_value` is obtained (from your `extract_model_intercept` function).
        ii. How `total_baseline_sales` is calculated using this `raw_intercept_value` and `len(df)`.
        iii.The warning logic if this `total_baseline_sales` is very low (e.g., <1% of `sum(y)`), ensuring the value itself is **not** altered to meet a heuristic target.
        iv. How `results["summary"]["actual_model_intercept"]` is set using this `total_baseline_sales`.
        v.  The "last resort" fallback logic if no intercept is found at all.

**Task 2: Report on Adstock/Saturation Parameter Extraction (for Model 26)**
    a.  Referring to the run of model 26 (which used increased MCMC settings: `draws=2000, tune=1000, chains=4`), please analyze and report your findings on:
        i.  Were sensible and distinct parameters for **adstock** (e.g., `alpha`, `l_max`) and **saturation** (e.g., `L`, `k`, `x0`) actually extracted and stored for the different channels from the model's output (e.g., from `az.summary(idata)` or `model_direct_params` within `train_mmm.py`)?
        ii. Or, did the script still appear to rely heavily on the default values it has for these parameters for most channels?

**Deliverables:**
1.  The Python code snippets requested in Task 1a.
2.  A written report for Task 2a detailing your findings on adstock and saturation parameter extraction for model 26.

Once these items are provided and reviewed, we will proceed with implementing the data diagnostic features you previously proposed.
