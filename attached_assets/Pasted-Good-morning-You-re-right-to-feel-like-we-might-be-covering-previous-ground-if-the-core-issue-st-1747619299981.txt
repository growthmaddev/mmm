Good morning!

You're right to feel like we might be "covering previous ground" if the core issue still boils down to "how we're retrieving and using the model parameters from Model ID 14." We've discussed and attempted fixes related to beta coefficients, saturation parameters (L, k, x0), and scaling several times.

If the problem still lies here after the various attempts to integrate the "successful test script logic," it suggests that there's a persistent disconnect or error in how python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py (the script called by your server) handles these crucial inputs from the stored results JSON of Model ID 14.

The agent has just stated: "I've identified the key issue with our budget optimizer. The problem lies in how we're retrieving and using the model parameters from Model ID 14."

This is a critical statement. To ensure we break out of any loop and definitively address this, we need absolute clarity from the agent.

My instruction to the Replit AI Agent is:

"Agent, you've stated that the key issue now lies in how python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is retrieving and using the model parameters from Model ID 14. This is a fundamental area we've tried to address before.

To ensure we fix this comprehensively and transparently this time, please:

Detail the Specific Problem with Parameter Handling:

"Exactly what is currently going wrong in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py regarding the retrieval or use of the parameters from Model ID 14's results JSON?
For example: Is it failing to read certain parameters (betas, L, k, x0, adstock alphas, baseline_sales/intercept)? Are they being read but are incorrect (e.g., default values, wrong scale, nulls)? Are they being misinterpreted or misapplied in the channel response or total outcome calculations?"
"If you compare the parameter handling logic in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py to your most successful standalone test script (e.g., optimize_budget_best.py or test_optimizer.py), what are the specific differences that are causing this problem in the live script?"
Outline Your Precise Fix:

"How do you plan to modify python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py right now to ensure it correctly retrieves and uses all necessary parameters (baseline_sales, and for each channel: its beta coefficient, its adstock parameters, and its L, k, x0 saturation parameters) from Model ID 14's results JSON?"
Implement the Fix and THEN Provide Detailed Trace:

"After you apply this precise fix to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:"
"Please immediately run Scenario B again (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14's parameters by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI)."
"Then, provide the complete server-side log output from this run of the fixed python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log is absolutely essential and MUST clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) being used.
For each marketing channel:
Its initial spend.
Its optimized spend.
The exact key parameters being used for it by the optimizer after your fix (beta coefficient, L, k, x0 for saturation, and adstock parameters as successfully retrieved from Model ID 14's results).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend.
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend.
The sum of channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used."
"Finally, please also show the UI output for this Scenario B run."
We need to see concrete evidence in the logs that the correct parameters are being fetched and used, and how they flow through the calculations to produce the final outcome and lift. This level of transparency is the only way to be sure this fundamental issue is resolved. Let's focus on getting this parameter handling perfect in the live script.
