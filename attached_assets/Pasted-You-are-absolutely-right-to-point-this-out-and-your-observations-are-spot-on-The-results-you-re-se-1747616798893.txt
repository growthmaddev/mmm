You are absolutely right to point this out, and your observations are spot on. The results you're seeing in the UI now, while showing a positive lift (which is an improvement over negative lift!), are indeed significantly different and less optimal than what the Replit AI Agent reported from its successful internal test script (test_optimizer.py or budget_optimizer_fix.py).

Let's compare clearly:

Previous Agent Report from Test Script (the "Good" results we were aiming for):

Scenario A (Same Budget $201,785): +27.71% lift
Scenario B (Increased Budget to $300,000): +45.15% lift
Budget Allocation Diversity (Scenario B): Top 2 channels had ~57% of the budget.
Current UI Results (from the integrated optimize_budget_marginal.py):

Scenario A (Same Budget $201,785):
Lift: +5.0%
Budget Allocation: PPCBrand $123k (61%), PPCNonBrand $72.8k (36%). Top 2 = 97% concentration.
Scenario B (Increased Budget to $300,000):
Lift: +5.0%
Budget Allocation: PPCBrand $134k (44.7%), PPCNonBrand $134k (44.7%). Top 2 = 89.3% concentration.
Key Discrepancies and Issues:

Lift Significantly Lower: The current +5% lift is much lower than the +27%/+45% previously reported as fixed in the test script.
Identical Lift for Different Scenarios: It's highly unusual for the lift to be exactly the same (5.0%) whether you're reallocating the same budget or increasing it substantially. This strongly suggests an issue in how the Expected Outcome (and thus lift) is being calculated relative to the budget changes in the live Python script.
Budget Concentration Remains Extreme: The diversity improvement (top 2 channels at ~57%) seen in the test script has not translated to the live script. We're still seeing 89-97% concentration in the top two PPC channels.
"Expected Outcome" Values:
Scenario A (Budget $201,785): Expected Outcome $241,242. (Initial Outcome would be 241,242/1.05â‰ˆ$229,754)
Scenario B (Budget $300,000): Expected Outcome $253,528.
The increase in budget by $98,215 (from $201,785 to $300,000) only yields an increase in expected outcome of $12,286 (from $241,242 to $253,528). This is an incremental ROI of only ~12.5% on the new money, which, while not impossible, might be low if other channels were truly zeroed out and the PPC channels aren't heavily saturated according to their actual fitted parameters.
Conclusion: The successful logic and improved algorithms that the agent validated in its test_optimizer.py (or budget_optimizer_fix.py) have not been correctly or completely transferred into the operational python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py that is being called by your application's backend.

My instruction to the Replit AI Agent is:

"Agent, thank you for running those UI tests. The user is correct: the results currently displayed in the UI (+5% lift in both scenarios, and ~90% budget concentration in the top 2 channels) are significantly different from, and much less optimal than, the results you previously reported from your isolated test script (which showed +27% to +45% lift and ~57% concentration).

This indicates that the successful fixes and refined logic from your test script have not yet been fully or correctly implemented in the main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script that the live server is calling.

We need to bridge this gap. Please:

Re-examine and Compare Scripts:

"Carefully compare the logic in your successful test script (test_optimizer.py or budget_optimizer_fix.py) with the current live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py."
"Identify all differences in how:
baseline_sales (intercept) is retrieved and used.
Channel response curves are calculated (application of beta coefficients, adstock, and the L, k, x0 saturation parameters).
Marginal ROI is calculated at each step of the iteration.
The iterative budget allocation/shifting logic is performed.
Minimum budget constraints or diversity enhancement logic is applied.
The predicted_initial_outcome and predicted_optimized_outcome are calculated for the lift calculation."
Apply ALL Successful Logic to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

"Ensure that all the successful code and logic from your test script are now meticulously and correctly transferred into the live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script. The goal is for the live script to replicate the behavior and superior results of your test script."
Retest from UI and Provide Detailed Logs & UI Output:

"Once you are confident that python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py fully mirrors the successful logic of your test script, please run our two standard test scenarios again by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:"
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785.
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000.
"Then, please provide:
The final UI output for both scenarios (Optimized Budget Allocation, Expected Outcome, and Lift %). We hope to see lifts closer to the +27%/+45% range and better diversity.
The detailed server-side log output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for Scenario B, showing the baseline, individual channel contributions (initial and optimized), total predicted outcomes (initial and optimized), and the lift calculation details."
It's crucial that the proven improvements from your test environment are now made fully operational in the main application script. Let's work to ensure the live optimizer performs as well as your successful test script indicated it could.
