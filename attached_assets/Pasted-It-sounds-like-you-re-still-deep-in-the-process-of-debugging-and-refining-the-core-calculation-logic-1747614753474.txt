It sounds like you're still deep in the process of debugging and refining the core calculation logic within python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This is often the most challenging part, and your persistence is appreciated.

You've correctly noted that even after the recent edits (related to saturation parameter handling, scaling, and debug output), the key problems persist:

The optimizer is still heavily favoring a few PPC channels.
Crucially, it's still showing a 0% lift in the expected outcome, even when the budget is increased.
This "0% lift" remains the biggest indicator that there's a fundamental issue in how the Python script calculates and compares the total predicted outcome for the initial versus the optimized budget allocations.

You're now focusing on "fixing the core calculation issues." This is the right direction.

As you continue to apply these fixes to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, please keep in mind what we need to see once you believe you've made progress:

Key Python Code Sections:

The function that calculates the sales contribution for a single channel (showing how spend, beta, adstock, and saturation parameters are used).
The section of code that calculates the total predicted outcome (summing individual channel contributions and, critically, adding the baseline_sales / intercept from the original MMM model).
The logic for calculating the lift percentage.
Detailed Log Output from a Test Run:

After you've applied your latest fixes, please run Scenario B again (using Model ID 14, initial budget $201,785, desired budget $300,000).
Then, provide the detailed log output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for this run. This log should show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) being used.
For each channel: its allocated spend in the optimized budget, and its calculated sales contribution.
The sum of all channel contributions before adding the baseline.
The final predicted_optimized_outcome (after adding the baseline).
The calculated predicted_initial_outcome (for the $201,785 budget) that's being used as the base for the lift calculation.
The calculated lift percentage.
Seeing these specific code sections and the detailed log output is essential for us to verify that the calculations are being performed correctly and to understand why the previous runs resulted in a 0% lift.

Please continue with your current focus on fixing these core calculation issues. I'll await your update once you've made further progress and are ready to share the code details and test logs.
