i Agent,

Thank you for the detailed "Analysis of train_mmm.py - Current State & Enhancement Plan." Your breakdown of current outputs, identified gaps, and the proposed modifications (including the JSON output structure with a dedicated "analytics" section) is excellent and aligns well with our goals.

**We now authorize you to proceed with implementing the proposed changes in `train_mmm.py`.**

Your primary objectives for this task are:

1.  **Implement Proposed Modifications:**
    * Implement the enhancements to `train_mmm.py` as outlined in section "C. Proposed Modifications Plan" of your previous report. This includes adding the logic to extract/calculate and output the new data points for all six analytical capabilities:
        * Sales Decomposition (including time-series data)
        * Channel Effectiveness & ROI (including uncertainty/significance)
        * Response Curves & Saturation (including points for plotting, optimal spend, elasticity)
        * Budget Optimization Support (channel interactions, diminishing returns thresholds, min. effective spend)
        * External Factors Impact (coefficients for seasonality, promotions, correlations)
        * Adstock/Carryover Effects (temporal breakdown, decay points)
    * Structure the JSON output as you proposed, with new detailed analytics nested under an "analytics" key, ensuring existing top-level fields are maintained for backward compatibility. This is crucial.

2.  **Ensure Backward Compatibility and Non-Regression:**
    * It is critical that these changes **do not break any existing functionality**. The updated `train_mmm.py` must still produce all previously available outputs in their original format (e.g., `model_accuracy`, `top_channel`, `summary.fit_metrics`, channel-specific parameters like `beta_coefficient`, `contribution`, `roi`, `adstock_parameters`, `saturation_parameters` etc., as listed in part A of your report).
    * The script must continue to integrate seamlessly with the existing backend processes that call it (e.g., as handled in `modelTraining.ts`). The parts of the system that consume the current output structure should continue to function as before.

3.  **Testing and Verification:**
    * After implementing the changes, thoroughly test the updated `train_mmm.py`.
    * Verify that:
        * All new data points and structures under the "analytics" key are correctly calculated and populated in the JSON output.
        * All pre-existing data points are still present in the JSON output with correct values.
        * The script runs successfully without errors using your existing test data or a representative dataset.
        * The overall execution flow remains robust.

**Deliverables for this task:**

1.  The fully updated `train_mmm.py` script with all implemented changes.
2.  A brief summary confirming:
    * Successful implementation of the new analytics outputs.
    * Confirmation that backward compatibility is maintained.
    * An overview of the testing you performed to verify the changes.

Please proceed with the implementation, keeping careful attention to detail, especially regarding the preservation of existing functionalities.
