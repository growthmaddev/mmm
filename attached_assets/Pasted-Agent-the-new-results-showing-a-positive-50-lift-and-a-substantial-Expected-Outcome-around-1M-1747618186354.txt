Agent, the new results showing a positive +50% lift and a substantial 'Expected Outcome' (around $1M) are a significant shift. However, the user is correct that the budget concentration remains extremely high.

Before you proceed with further changes like 'increasing the scaling factor' or 'improving diversity protection,' it is absolutely critical that we understand how the current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is arriving at these numbers.

We still need the detailed calculation trace that I've requested previously. Please, for Scenario B (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14 parameters):

Ensure python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py has detailed print() statements for debugging.
Run this scenario by triggering the optimization from the UI.
Provide the complete server-side log output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for this run. This log MUST clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) being used from Model ID 14.
For each marketing channel (including those allocated minimal budget):
Its initial spend (from the $201,785 allocation).
Its optimized spend (in the $300,000 allocation).
The key parameters being used for it by the optimizer (beta coefficient, and the actual L, k, x0 for saturation, and adstock parameters).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend (after all scaling).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend (after all scaling).
The sum of all channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of all channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome" (e.g., $1,008,951).
The calculated lift percentage (e.g., +50.0%), showing the two total outcome values that were compared to arrive at this lift.
Key Questions Based on the Current Output:

How is an "Expected Outcome" of ~$1,008,951 generated if, as previously noted by you, individual channel contributions might be very small (e.g., "$10 per channel for top channels")? This implies the baseline_sales (intercept) must be very large. Please confirm this.
If the baseline is indeed very large, the +50% lift means the sum of marketing contributions has increased very substantially. We need to see how.
Why are most channels still receiving minimal budget if the goal is to maximize overall outcome? Are their fitted saturation 'L' values (maximum potential) extremely low, or their betas extremely low, even after your fixes?
Understanding this detailed calculation flow is the only way to confirm if the optimizer's core logic is now sound (even if leading to concentration due to the specific model parameters) or if there are still fundamental errors in how contributions, total outcome, and lift are being calculated. We cannot effectively work on 'diversity protection' or 'scaling factors' without this foundational clarity."
