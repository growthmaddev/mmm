Thank you for the update and for creating the UI components for the 'Channel Impact' tab. It's crucial that this tab displays actual results from the trained PyMC-Marketing model, not placeholder or synthetic data.

Before we move to the 'Technical Details' tab or add more visualizations, please prioritize the following for the 'Channel Impact' tab:

Ensure python_scripts/train_mmm.py Provides All Necessary Data:

Confirm that train_mmm.py is successfully extracting and saving the following for each model run (as we discussed previously):
Time-series contributions: For baseline, each control variable, and each marketing channel.
Total contributions: Aggregated for each of the above.
Parameters for response curves: Beta, L, k, x0 per channel.
Actual historical spend per channel.
If any of this is still missing from train_mmm.py's output, please enhance train_mmm.py first to ensure this data is generated and saved in a structured JSON file associated with the model ID.
Update Backend API to Serve This Detailed Data:

Modify the relevant API endpoint (likely in server/controllers/models.ts or a similar file) to load and provide this new, detailed JSON data (from step 1) when the frontend requests results for a specific model ID.
Update ChannelImpactContent.tsx to Use Real Model Data:

Modify ChannelImpactContent.tsx (and its child chart components) to fetch this comprehensive model data from the updated API endpoint.
Remove all reliance on placeholder data or synthetic data generation for all charts and tables in this tab. If the data isn't available from the API for a specific model, the charts should indicate "Data not available" or be hidden, rather than showing synthetic information.
Ensure the "Contribution Over Time" chart specifically uses the time-series decomposition (baseline, controls, channels) from the model.
Implement Correct Percentage Calculations:

Using the actual model contribution data fetched, implement the following distinct calculations in the "Contribution Analysis" table:
Total_Sales_Outcome_Predicted = Total_Baseline_Contribution + sum(Total_Control_Var_Contributions) + sum(Total_Marketing_Channel_Contributions)
Total_Marketing_Driven_Sales_Predicted = sum(Total_Marketing_Channel_Contributions)
For each Channel X:
"% of Total Outcome": (Total_Channel_X_Contribution / Total_Sales_Outcome_Predicted) * 100
"% of Marketing Driven": (Total_Channel_X_Contribution / Total_Marketing_Driven_Sales_Predicted) * 100
Ensure the "Spend" column correctly displays the actual historical spend for each channel.
Test with Actual Model Data:

Once these changes are made, please test the 'Channel Impact' tab using Model ID 14. We expect to see:
The "Contribution Over Time" chart reflecting actual model decomposition.
Different values for "% of Total Outcome" and "% of Marketing Driven" if the baseline and control variable contributions are non-zero.
Correct spend figures.
ROI and response curves driven by actual model parameters.
Let's focus entirely on getting the 'Channel Impact' tab to accurately and completely reflect the outputs of train_mmm.py before considering new visualizations or the 'Technical Details' tab."

This clear directive should guide the agent to fix the data pipeline issue, which is the most critical task right now.
