Hi Agent,

Thank you for your recent work. Before we proceed to implementing new features like the full data diagnostics, we need to finalize and verify the critical fixes to `train_mmm.py` and gather some pending information from the model 26 run (which used increased MCMC settings).

Your immediate ordered tasks are:

1.  **Task 1: Provide Final Code for Intercept Logic:**
    * You've stated that the intercept logic in `train_mmm.py` has been revised to ensure "The original model-learned intercept is now preserved without arbitrary adjustments" and that it "Only uses fallback heuristic as a last resort when no intercept is found".
    * Please provide the **final Python code snippet(s)** from `train_mmm.py` that demonstrate:
        * How the raw `intercept_value` is obtained from the model (via the `extract_model_intercept` function).
        * How `total_baseline_sales` is calculated purely from this `raw_intercept_value` and the number of data periods (`len(df)`).
        * The logic for any warnings if this `total_baseline_sales` is very low (e.g., <1% of `sum(y)`), confirming the value itself is not altered to meet a heuristic target like "20% of total sales".
        * How the final value for `results["summary"]["actual_model_intercept"]` is set using this `total_baseline_sales`.

2.  **Task 2: Report on Adstock/Saturation Parameter Extraction (for Model 26):**
    * Referring to the run of model 26 (which used increased MCMC settings: `draws=2000, tune=1000, chains=4`), please report your findings on whether sensible, distinct parameters for **adstock** (e.g., `alpha`) and **saturation** (e.g., `L`, `k`, `x0`) were actually extracted for different channels from the model's output (`az.summary(idata)` or `model_direct_params` in `train_mmm.py`), or if the script still appeared to rely heavily on default values for these parameters.

Once these two tasks are completed and the information is provided, we can be fully confident in the current state of `train_mmm.py`'s core outputs.
