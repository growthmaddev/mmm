Single Comprehensive Prompt for Workflow Integration Status Report
For Replit: Based on the verification script results, let me provide a complete status report on the MMM fixed parameter integration across the workflow and identify what still needs to be done.
CURRENT INTEGRATION STATUS:
✅ COMPLETED:

Model Training (server/controllers/modelTraining.ts)

Now uses fit_mmm_fixed_params.py
Config transformation implemented
Results transformer added


Budget Optimizer (server/controllers/mmmOptimizerController.ts)

Integrated with new MMM optimizer service
Project/model context handled
Connected to mmm_optimizer_service.py


Data Handling (server/controllers/dataSources.ts)

DD/MM/YYYY date format support added
Comma-separated number cleaning implemented
Improved type detection



⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION/COMPLETION:

Data Upload (/projects/37/data-upload)

Need to verify the upload controller uses our data cleaning
Check if date format handling is applied at upload time


Column Mapping (/projects/37/column-mapping-direct)

Verify channel identification works with cleaned data
Ensure control columns are properly mapped


Model Setup (/projects/37/model-setup)

Check if parameter configuration matches our fixed param format
Verify adstock/saturation settings are saved correctly


Results Display (/projects/37/results?model=29)

Confirm all tabs show data from our fixed param results
Verify sales decomposition works with our output format



EXECUTE THESE VERIFICATION COMMANDS:

Check if model setup saves config in our expected format:

bashgrep -n "channels\|alpha\|saturation" client/src/pages/projects/*/model-setup.tsx | head -20

Verify results page can display our fixed param output:

bashgrep -n "channel_roi\|contribution_percentage\|sales_decomposition" client/src/pages/projects/*/results.tsx | head -20

Check column mapping compatibility:

bashgrep -n "channelColumns\|controlColumns\|dateColumn" client/src/pages/projects/*/column-mapping*.tsx | head -20

Create a test to verify end-to-end workflow:

bashcat > test_full_workflow.md << 'EOF'
# Full Workflow Integration Test

## Test Steps:
1. Create new project
2. Upload test data (dankztestdata_v2.csv)
3. Map columns (Date, Sales, Channels, Controls)
4. Configure model parameters
5. Run training with fixed params
6. View results (all tabs)
7. Run budget optimizer

## Expected Results:
- [ ] Data uploads with DD/MM/YYYY dates parsed correctly
- [ ] Numeric columns with commas cleaned automatically
- [ ] Model trains using fit_mmm_fixed_params.py
- [ ] Results show ROI, contributions, decomposition
- [ ] Budget optimizer provides recommendations

## Current Issues:
- Need to verify each step uses our improvements
- Some UI components may expect different result formats
- Additional MM features (curves, scenarios) not implemented
EOF
NEXT PRIORITY ACTIONS:

Update Results Page to properly display fixed param outputs
Verify Model Setup saves configuration in our expected format
Test Full Workflow end-to-end with a real project
Implement Media Mix Curves visualization (high priority feature)

Report the output from the verification commands above.
DO NOT:

Start implementing new features yet
Modify multiple components simultaneously
Change the core workflow structure

STOP after running the verification commands and reporting what integration gaps remain.
