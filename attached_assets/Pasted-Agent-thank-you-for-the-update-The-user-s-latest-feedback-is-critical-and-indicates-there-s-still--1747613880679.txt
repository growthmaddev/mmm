Agent, thank you for the update. The user's latest feedback is critical and indicates there's still a fundamental issue with the python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script, despite the recent fixes. The key problems are:

When optimizing with the same total budget, it makes no changes to the channel allocation. This might be acceptable if the current allocation is already perceived as optimal by the algorithm, but it's worth noting.
When increasing the budget (e.g., from $201,785 to $300,000), it still zeroes out most channels and overfunds a few PPC channels.
Most importantly, the optimizer reports an 'expected outcome is a 0% lift' even with a significant budget increase and reallocation. This is the biggest concern.
This '0% lift' strongly suggests an issue in how the Python script calculates the predicted_optimized_outcome or the baseline it's comparing against.

To debug this, please provide the following specific sections of code from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py and any relevant explanations:

Channel Response Function:

Show the Python function that calculates the predicted sales contribution for a single channel given its spend, beta_coefficient, adstock_parameters (e.g., alpha, l_max), and saturation_parameters (e.g., L, k, x0). We need to see how adstock and saturation are being applied to the spend before being multiplied by the beta.
Total Predicted Outcome Calculation:

Show the Python function or section of code that takes a full budget allocation (spend for each channel), calculates the contribution from each channel using the function from point 1, and then sums these contributions and adds the baseline_sales (intercept from the MMM model) to arrive at the total predicted outcome. This is critical.
Optimization Loop & Marginal Return Logic:

Show the main loop or function that iteratively allocates the desired_total_budget. How is it calculating marginal return for each channel at each step?
Lift Calculation Logic:

Show how the '% lift' is calculated. Specifically, what is the predicted_optimized_outcome being compared against? Is it comparing against an outcome calculated using the initial budget allocation and the same response curve logic + baseline_sales?
Minimum Budget Constraints Implementation:

You mentioned adding 'minimum budget constraints.' Please show how these are implemented and how they interact with the optimization logic. Could these constraints be preventing any change when the budget is the same, or forcing the optimizer into a state where it can't find a better solution that yields a positive lift?
Key questions for you to investigate within the Python script's logic:

Is the baseline_sales (intercept) correctly and consistently added to the sum of channel contributions when calculating the total predicted outcome for any given budget allocation (both for the 'current/initial' state and the 'optimized' state)? If the baseline is missing or handled inconsistently, the lift calculation will be incorrect.
If the total budget is increased and allocated to channels that (according to the model parameters) should have some positive marginal return (at least initially), why would the predicted_optimized_outcome not increase? This points to a potential issue in the response curve calculation or the summation of outcomes.
How does the script determine the 'current' or 'baseline' total outcome to calculate the lift against? Is it using the same response curve logic and intercept for the initial allocation as it does for the optimized one?
Please focus on providing these code snippets and your analysis of the outcome and lift calculation. This will help us understand why the optimizer is reporting a 0% lift despite significant budget changes.
