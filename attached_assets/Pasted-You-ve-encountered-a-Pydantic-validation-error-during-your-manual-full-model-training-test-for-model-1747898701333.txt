You've encountered a Pydantic validation error during your manual full model training test for model 25. This is a valuable clue!

The error message:
Model training error: 1 validation error for AdstockTransformation.__init__ alpha Unexpected keyword argument [type=unexpected_keyword_argument, input_value=0.5492722009910553, input_type=float]

Means that when the AdstockTransformation class (likely part of PyMC-Marketing or a custom class in train_mmm.py) was being initialized, it received an unexpected keyword argument named alpha with a float value. Pydantic models are strict about the arguments they accept during initialization.

This error is happening after you initiated the training, suggesting it's occurring when train_mmm.py tries to set up the adstock transformations, possibly with the new adaptive/data-driven parameters the Agent was working on.

How We Should Proceed
You are correct, we need to diagnose this before moving on. The Agent should investigate and fix this error in train_mmm.py.

Here's the immediate plan:

Agent to Debug AdstockTransformation Initialization: The Agent needs to examine how adstock transformations are being set up in train_mmm.py, specifically how the AdstockTransformation (or GeometricAdstock, etc., whichever class is relevant) is being instantiated.
The Agent previously reported implementing data-driven adstock parameters: "The system now attempts to learn alpha (decay rate) from the data..." and has fallbacks. It's likely that in the process of making alpha data-driven or learnable, it's being passed to the AdstockTransformation class in a way that Pydantic doesn't expect (e.g., perhaps the class expects alpha as part of a dictionary or a specific attribute, not as a direct keyword argument in some contexts, or there's a typo).
Prompt for the Replit AI Agent: Debug AdstockTransformation Initialization Error

Hi Agent,

The user attempted to run a full model training (model 25) using the enhanced `train_mmm.py` with robust MCMC settings. The training failed with the following Pydantic validation error:

`Model training error: 1 validation error for AdstockTransformation.__init__ alpha Unexpected keyword argument [type=unexpected_keyword_argument, input_value=0.5492722009910553, input_type=float]`

This indicates an issue with how the `AdstockTransformation` class (or a similar adstock class like `GeometricAdstock` from PyMC-Marketing) is being initialized, specifically with an unexpected `alpha` keyword argument. This likely relates to the recent enhancements for data-driven or learnable adstock parameters.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Investigate Adstock Setup in `train_mmm.py`:**
    * Examine the parts of `train_mmm.py` where adstock transformations are defined and instantiated for each channel (e.g., within the `train_model` function, possibly when setting up `media_transforms` or similar).
    * Identify how the `alpha` parameter (and potentially other adstock parameters like `l_max`) are being determined and passed to the adstock class constructor.

2.  **Identify the Cause of the Pydantic Error:**
    * Determine why Pydantic is flagging `alpha` as an "Unexpected keyword argument." This could be due to:
        * The specific adstock class in the version of PyMC-Marketing being used not accepting `alpha` as a direct keyword argument during `__init__`.
        * A typo in the argument name.
        * The `alpha` value needing to be part of a parameter dictionary passed to the constructor, rather than a direct keyword.
        * A mismatch between how `alpha` is defined/learned and how it's being passed to the transformation class.

3.  **Implement a Fix:**
    * Modify `train_mmm.py` to correctly initialize the adstock transformation classes with the `alpha` parameter (and others) in a way that is compatible with their Pydantic models.
    * Ensure that your logic for data-driven or learnable `alpha` values is correctly integrated with this initialization.

4.  **Test (Quick Sanity Check):**
    * After implementing the fix, perform a quick sanity check run of `train_mmm.py` (with fast MCMC settings and the `test_data.csv`) to ensure this specific Pydantic error is resolved and the script can proceed past the adstock setup phase.

**Deliverables:**
1.  The updated `train_mmm.py` script with the fix for the `AdstockTransformation` initialization.
2.  An explanation of the root cause of the error and how you resolved it.
3.  Confirmation from your quick sanity check that the Pydantic error no longer occurs.

Resolving this error is critical before the user can successfully run a full model training to evaluate the impact of all the recent enhancements.
