Good morning!

That's a very significant set of observations and a crucial breakthrough in understanding why the Budget Optimizer has been producing those strange results (0% lift, extreme allocations).

You've identified three critical issues:

Missing or Zero Channel Coefficients (Betas) in the Real Application: This is indeed a showstopper. If the beta coefficients, which are fundamental to determining the magnitude of each channel's contribution, are not being correctly passed to or used by optimize_budget_marginal.py, then the predicted contributions will naturally be zero or near-zero, leading directly to a 0% lift.
Scaling Factor Too High (1000): An incorrect scaling factor can drastically distort the calculations, making contributions appear much smaller than they should be, or causing numerical instability in the optimization.
Contribution Calculations Producing Extremely Small Values: This is a direct symptom of the missing/zero betas and/or the incorrect scaling.
It's excellent that you've pinpointed these. Addressing them is the top priority.

You said, "Let me fix the core issue in the budget optimizer." As you proceed with these fixes, please focus on and then clarify the following:

Beta Coefficient Handling (Most Important):

Where was the issue with the beta coefficients?
Were they not being saved correctly by train_mmm.py into the results JSON for each channel?
Was server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts failing to extract them correctly from the stored results and pass them to python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py?
Or was optimize_budget_marginal.py not correctly receiving or applying these beta values in its get_channel_response function?
How will you ensure the correct, non-zero beta coefficients (from the successfully trained Model ID 14, for example) are now being used for each channel within the optimization logic?
Scaling Factor Adjustment:

Where is this scaling factor of 1000 being applied, and what is its purpose?
How will you adjust it to be appropriate, and how will you determine the correct scaling? (Often, models are built with inputs scaled for numerical stability, and outputs need to be rescaled, but this must be done consistently).
Impact on get_channel_response and Total Outcome Calculation:

After fixing the beta and scaling issues, how will the get_channel_response function in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py change?
How will this affect the calculation of individual channel contributions and the final predicted_optimized_outcome (which must include the baseline_sales intercept)?
After you have implemented these fixes:

Please run the same test scenario again (Model ID 14, initial budget $201,785, desired budget $300,000).
Then, provide the detailed log output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py as we discussed before. This log should clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept) value used.
For each channel: its allocated spend, the beta coefficient being used for it, its other key parameters (adstock, saturation), and its calculated sales contribution.
The sum of all channel contributions.
The final predicted_optimized_outcome.
The predicted_initial_outcome.
The calculated lift percentage.
And, of course, the final Optimized Budget Allocation recommended by the script.
These fixes sound like they will address the root cause of the problems we've been seeing. I'm very optimistic about the outcome of this next iteration! Let me know how the fixes go and what the subsequent test run reveals.
