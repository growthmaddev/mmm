Okay, thank you for sharing the UI results of the two test scenarios. Let's analyze these:

Scenario 1: Same Budget ($201,785)

Expected Outcome: $1,008,925
Lift: 0.0% decrease (effectively 0% lift, which is expected)
Allocation: All channels show 0% change from their current optimized (which means current starting) spend.
PPCBrand: $8,697
PPCNonBrand: $33,283
PPCShopping: $13,942
PPCLocal: $14,980
PPCPMax: $3,911
FBReach: $19,743
FBDPA: $19,408
OfflineMedia: $87,821
Total: $201,785
Interpretation for Same Budget:
This result is logically correct and good. When the desired budget is the same as the current budget, and we've simplified the optimizer to prioritize existing parameters and straightforward calculations, it should ideally recommend keeping the current allocation if it cannot find a better one, leading to 0% lift. The UI showing "0.0% decrease" is likely a minor display rounding or floating point precision matter if the underlying expected outcome is infinitesimally smaller than the current outcome before rounding. The key is that the allocation didn't change, and lift is effectively zero.

Scenario 2: Increased Budget ($300,000 from $201,785)

Expected Outcome: $1,008,926
Lift: (This is missing from the screenshot, but based on the "Expected Outcome" being virtually identical to the "Same Budget" scenario, the lift will also be 0% or very close to it, relative to the original outcome from the $201,785 spend).
Allocation:
PPCBrand: $90,000 (+935%)
PPCNonBrand: $90,000 (+170%)
PPCShopping: $90,000 (+546%)
PPCLocal: $22,000 (+47%)
PPCPMax: $2,000 (-49%)
FBReach: $2,000 (-90%)
FBDPA: $2,000 (-90%)
OfflineMedia: $2,000 (-98%)
Total: $300,000 (90+90+90+22+2+2+2+2 = 300)
Interpretation for Increased Budget:

This scenario reveals significant issues:

Expected Outcome/Lift is Far Too Low: The "Expected Outcome" is $1,008,926, which is the same as the outcome for the $201,785 budget. This means the additional $98,215 in budget effectively generated $1 in additional outcome. This is clearly incorrect and does not align with the expected +45% lift. The lift displayed as "0.0% decrease" against the original $201k spend's outcome is therefore also wrong.
Extreme Budget Concentration (but different from before):
Three channels (PPCBrand, PPCNonBrand, PPCShopping) are each allocated $90,000, totaling $270,000 out of $300,000 (90% of the budget in the top 3 channels).
PPCLocal gets $22,000.
The remaining four channels (PPCPMax, FBReach, FBDPA, OfflineMedia) are reduced to a minimal $2,000 each, despite some of them having significant spend in the initial allocation (e.g., OfflineMedia was $87,821).
This is extreme and doesn't reflect the "good budget diversity (e.g., top 2 channels having ~57% of budget)" we were aiming for from the successful standalone tests.
Diagnosis and Next Steps Based on UI Results:

The "Same Budget" scenario working correctly is a good sign that some foundational aspects of parameter handling might be stable. However, the "Increased Budget" scenario indicates that the core logic for calculating marginal returns and allocating additional budget is still flawed.

The most likely culprits, despite the recent changes, could still be:

Parameter Interpretation (Saturation x0, Betas): Even if we are using Model ID 14 parameters and have reduced "aggressive fixing," the values themselves (especially x0 relative to spend, or very small betas) might be leading to near-instant saturation or negligible returns for most channels when more budget is added. If a channel's x0 is very small, any spend above it yields minimal additional return. If betas are tiny, the impact is also minimal.
Calculation of Channel Response/Marginal Return: There might be an issue in how get_channel_response or calculate_marginal_return are evaluating the impact of additional spend. If the marginal returns for most channels flatline or become near-zero very quickly, the optimizer would pour money into the few that show any return, or it might hit a calculation floor.
Diversity Factor Not Working as Expected or Overridden: While we adjusted the formula, if marginal returns are extremely skewed (e.g., one channel is 1000x better than others), the diversity factor might not be enough to prevent this level of concentration. Or, the optimizer might be stopping prematurely.
Baseline Sales Dominance: If baseline_sales is very large compared to the channel contributions, changes in channel contributions (even if correctly calculated in raw terms) might appear as very small percentage lifts in the total outcome. The expected outcome of ~$1M suggests a substantial baseline.
We absolutely need the Python script's stderr logs from the $300,000 budget optimization run. These logs will show:

The actual channel_params (beta, L, k, x0, adstock) used for each channel.
The baseline_sales value.
The marginal returns calculated for each channel at various points in the allocation.
How contributions were summed up.

"Agent, thank you for running the tests and providing the UI screenshots.

The 'Same Budget' scenario appears to be working correctly, which is good.

However, the 'Increased Budget' scenario (to $300,000) shows critical issues:

The Expected Outcome is $1,008,926, virtually unchanged from the $201,785 budget scenario. This means the additional ~$98k in budget yielded almost no extra return, and the lift is effectively 0%, far from our target of ~+45%.
The budget allocation is extremely concentrated: PPCBrand, PPCNonBrand, and PPCShopping each received $90,000, while four other channels were cut to a minimal $2,000. This is not the desired diverse allocation.
To diagnose this, please provide the complete stderr console output from the python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script specifically for the $300,000 budget optimization run.

This output should include:

The initial channel_params (beta, L, k, x0, adstock settings) for each channel that were loaded and used.
The baseline_sales value used.
Debug prints showing marginal returns calculated during the allocation process.
The calculated current_outcome (for the $201,785 spend) and the expected_outcome (for the $300,000 spend) before any UI display.
The calculated unscaled contributions for each channel under both current and optimized allocations.
The final lift percentage calculated by the Python script.
This detailed log is essential for understanding why the optimizer is behaving this way with an increased budget.
