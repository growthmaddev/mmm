Agent, thank you for that excellent and transparent explanation of the current budget optimizer's logic. It's very helpful to understand that it's using average ROIs.

To make the Budget Optimizer significantly more robust and its recommendations more aligned with MMM theory, let's now focus on enhancing its algorithm to optimize based on marginal returns, leveraging the saturation curve parameters from our PyMC-Marketing model.

Here's a proposed plan:

Ensure Saturation Parameters are Available:

First, please confirm that the results JSON produced by train_mmm.py (and stored in the database for each model run) includes the necessary parameters that define the saturation curve for each channel (e.g., the fitted α (alpha_saturation) and λ (lambda_saturation) from the Hill function, or equivalent parameters if a different saturation function is used by default in pymc-marketing.MMM).
If these are not currently being explicitly saved, please update train_mmm.py to include them in its JSON output.
Develop/Utilize Marginal Return-Based Optimization Logic (Backend):

The ideal way to implement this is to leverage the pymc-marketing.mmm.MMM.optimize_budget() method if possible, as this method is designed to use the fitted model's response curves.
Option A (Preferred): Can we create/update a Python utility script (callable by server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts) that:
Loads the necessary parameters of a previously fitted model (e.g., model ID 14). This might involve loading the saved coefficients, adstock parameters, and the saturation parameters you identified in step 1.
Re-constructs enough of the model's structure (or uses a lightweight way to access the response functions) to then call a method equivalent to mmm.optimize_budget() from pymc-marketing, providing the user's desired_total_budget.
This Python script would then return the optimized budget allocation and expected outcome as JSON to the Node.js controller.
Option B (If Option A is too complex for an immediate step): If using the built-in optimize_budget() directly is challenging, the Python utility script would need to:
For each channel, use its saturation parameters (e.g., α,λ) and coefficient (β) to define its response curve function: response=β⋅Hill(spend,λ,α).
Implement an iterative optimization algorithm (e.g., a greedy approach):
Start with zero spend on all channels.
In small increments, allocate the next portion of the desired_total_budget to the channel that provides the highest marginal return for that incremental spend.
Repeat until the total desired budget is allocated.
This also requires being able to calculate the derivative of the response curve or approximate the marginal return for a small Δspend.
Update Node.js Controller (budgetOptimization.ts):

Modify the controller to call this new/updated Python script, passing the relevant model parameters (or an identifier for the model run) and the user's budget inputs.
Ensure it correctly receives and then passes on the optimized allocation and predicted outcome from the Python script to the frontend.
Frontend (budget-optimizer.tsx):

The frontend should continue to display the results as before. The key change is that the "Optimized Budget Allocation" it receives from the backend will now be based on this more sophisticated marginal return logic.
This is a significant enhancement, so let's break it down. Please start by:
a.  Investigating and confirming what saturation parameters train_mmm.py currently makes available in its results JSON.
b.  Sharing your thoughts on the feasibility of Option A (using pymc-marketing's optimize_budget method or similar via a Python script) versus Option B (implementing the iterative marginal return logic).

This will give us a clearer path forward for this important upgrade to the Budget Optimizer.
