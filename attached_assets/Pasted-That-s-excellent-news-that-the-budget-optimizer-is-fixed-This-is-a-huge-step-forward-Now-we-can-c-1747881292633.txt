That's excellent news that the budget optimizer is fixed! This is a huge step forward.

Now we can confidently turn our attention back to the frontend and make all that rich new analytical data from train_mmm.py accessible and useful to your users.

Thank you for providing the current ModelResults page code from MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx/results.tsx]. I've reviewed it, and it gives us a good understanding of the existing structure:

It handles model loading, including polling for status updates during training.
It displays progress and error states clearly.
For completed models, it uses a tab structure: "Overview", "Channel Impact", "Budget Optimization", and "Technical Details"/results.tsx].
The "Overview" tab currently shows some high-level insights and recommendations derived from the older model output structure/results.tsx].
The "Channel Impact" and "Technical Details" tabs are currently placeholders/results.tsx].
This existing structure, especially the tabs, provides a good framework for integrating the new, more detailed analytics.

Here's the prompt for the Replit AI Agent to begin the analysis and proposal phase for these frontend updates.

Prompt for the Replit AI Agent: Design Frontend for New Analytics in Model Results Page

Hi Agent,

With the backend fixes now successfully implemented and the budget optimizer working, `train_mmm.py` is providing a comprehensive "analytics" section in its JSON output.

Our next goal is to present these new, rich insights to users on the model results page. Please refer to the existing frontend code for this page: `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`/results.tsx].

**For this task, please focus *only on analysis and proposing UI/UX changes*. Do NOT implement any code changes at this stage.**

Your objectives are to:

1.  **Understand New Data & Existing UI:**
    * Thoroughly review the structure and content of the new "analytics" section in the JSON output from `train_mmm.py` (this includes sales decomposition, detailed channel effectiveness with ROI CIs, response curve data, optimization parameters, external factor impacts, and temporal adstock effects).
    * Analyze the current `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`/results.tsx], paying attention to its existing tab structure ("Overview", "Channel Impact", "Budget Optimization", "Technical Details") and how it currently displays information for completed models.

2.  **Propose Frontend Enhancements for `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`:**
    * For **each** of the six new analytical areas now available in the "analytics" section, propose how these insights could be visualized and presented. Consider integrating these into the existing tabs or suggest modifications/additions to the tab structure if more appropriate.
        * **Sales Decomposition:** How can we best show base vs. incremental sales, channel contributions (including percentages), and the time-series breakdown?
        * **Channel Effectiveness & ROI:** How can we display ROI with confidence intervals, statistical significance, cost-per-outcome, and effectiveness rankings in a user-friendly way?
        * **Response Curves & Saturation:** How should the response curve plots, optimal spend points, and elasticity metrics be presented?
        * **Budget Optimization Support Data:** How (and if) should data like channel interaction matrices (noting it's currently a placeholder in backend), diminishing returns thresholds, and min. effective spend be shown to a non-technical marketer? Perhaps some of this is more suited for the "Technical Details" tab or summarized into simpler insights.
        * **External Factors Impact:** How should the (currently placeholder) impact of seasonality, promotions, etc., be displayed if/when available?
        * **Adstock/Carryover Effects:** How can immediate vs. lagged impact, decay points, and effective frequency be visualized clearly?
    * **Prioritize User Accessibility:** For all proposals, the primary goal is clarity and actionability for non-technical marketers. Avoid overly technical jargon in the UI.
    * **Visualization Ideas:** Suggest appropriate chart types (e.g., leveraging existing `ContributionChart.tsx` or `ResponseCurveChart.tsx` if suitable, or proposing new ones), tables, and textual summaries.
    * **Highlight Key Takeaways:** How can the UI draw attention to the most important findings or actionable advice from each analysis?

3.  **Suggest a Phased Implementation Approach:**
    * Given the breadth of new data, recommend which 1 or 2 of these new analytical displays would be most impactful to implement first within `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`. Consider a balance of user value and implementation complexity.

**Deliverable for this task:**
Please provide a written report detailing:
    * Your proposals for UI/UX changes for each of the six analytical areas, including how they might fit into the existing tab structure of `MarketMixMaster/client/src/pages/projects/[id]/results.tsx`. Descriptive mock-ups or simple sketches are encouraged.
    * Your recommendation for which 1-2 analytical areas to prioritize for the initial frontend implementation phase.

We will review your proposals thoroughly before authorizing any frontend coding.
