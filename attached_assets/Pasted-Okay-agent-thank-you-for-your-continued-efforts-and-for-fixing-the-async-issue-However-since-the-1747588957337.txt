Okay, agent, thank you for your continued efforts and for fixing the async issue. However, since the frontend is still reporting 'Received invalid data from the server,' we absolutely must now focus on inspecting the data flow with the detailed logging you mentioned you were adding.

Please do not make further changes to the controller logic for now. Instead, please perform these diagnostic steps and show me the exact outputs:

Show Backend Controller Logs (Most Critical):

"You mentioned you added detailed logging to server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts. Please:
Trigger the budget optimization again from the frontend UI for Model ID 14 (using sample budget inputs).
Show me the complete server-side console logs that are generated by budgetOptimization.ts during this specific request.
These logs should ideally show (as we discussed previously):
The modelId, current_budget, desired_budget, and current_allocation received by the controller.
The full model.results JSON object that the controller fetches from the database for Model ID 14.
The exact optimization results object that the controller constructs before it sends the response (i.e., just before res.json(...))."
Show Direct API Response (Using curl):

"After triggering from the UI (to generate the logs above), please also execute the curl command again to directly call the /api/models/14/optimize-budget endpoint with valid sample inputs.
Show me the complete and exact JSON response body AND the HTTP status code that curl receives from this direct API call."
Show Frontend Log of Received Data:

"In client/src/pages/projects/[id]/budget-optimizer.tsx, please ensure you still have the console.log() statement that prints the raw API response data immediately after it's received by the frontend (as we discussed in my previous instructions).
Trigger the optimization from the UI again.
Show me what this frontend console.log() statement prints in the browser's developer console. This will tell us what the frontend is actually seeing."
Why this is crucial:

The server logs (Step 1) will tell us if the controller is correctly fetching model.results, if it's correctly performing calculations, and what data it intends to send.
The curl output (Step 2) will tell us what the API endpoint actually sends out, bypassing any frontend complexities.
The frontend log (Step 3) will tell us what the React component actually receives.
The discrepancy between these points will pinpoint where the "invalid data" issue originates. We must see this data trail. Please focus on providing these logged outputs. We will not make further code changes until we have analyzed these logs.

Let's try to get these diagnostic outputs before we conclude for the night.
