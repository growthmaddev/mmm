Good morning!

You are absolutely right to point out that we seem to be in a loop, and the latest results from the Budget Optimizer (0.0% decrease in lift, and 98.3% budget concentration in the top 3 channels for Scenario B) are indeed a significant step backward from the promising results the agent had previously reported from its isolated test scripts (which showed +27% to +45% lift and ~57% concentration).

This strongly indicates that the "clean version" or "proven logic" from python_scripts/optimize_budget_best.py (or whichever test script produced those good results) has not been successfully or correctly transferred and made operational within the live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py script that your server calls.

The agent's statement "I've replaced the optimizer script with a clean version containing the proven logic from our successful test scripts" is, unfortunately, not borne out by these latest UI results. There's a clear disconnect.

We must get to the bottom of why the live, integrated script is behaving so differently. Further "enhancements" or tweaks are pointless until the fundamental calculation engine within python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is proven to be correct and matches the logic that did produce good results in isolation.

My instruction to the Replit AI Agent is:

"Agent, thank you for running the test. However, as the user has correctly pointed out, the results from this latest run of python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py (0.0% decrease in lift, ~98% budget concentration) are drastically different from, and much worse than, the promising results (+27% to +45% lift, ~57% concentration) you previously reported from your successful isolated test scripts (like test_optimizer.py or budget_optimizer_fix.py or optimize_budget_best.py).

This means that the successful core logic from those test scripts is still not functioning correctly within the live, integrated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. We need to stop the cycle of tweaks and address this fundamental discrepancy.

To do this, please provide the following with utmost detail and precision, focusing on the current, active python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py that produced these latest problematic results:

Show Critical Python Code Sections (from the current live optimize_budget_marginal.py):

"Please provide the actual Python code snippets for the following functions/sections as they exist right now in the python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py that was just executed:
The function that calculates the sales contribution for a single channel (showing how spend, beta, adstock parameters, and the L, k, x0 saturation parameters are used).
The section of code that calculates the total predicted outcome (for both the initial/current allocation and the optimized allocation). This must clearly show how individual channel contributions are summed and how the baseline_sales (intercept from Model ID 14) is incorporated.
The main iterative budget allocation loop (how it determines marginal ROI and decides where to allocate the next increment of budget).
The section of code that calculates the lift percentage."
Detailed Logged Output from This Specific Problematic Scenario B Run:

"We need the complete server-side log output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for this exact Scenario B run (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14 parameters) that produced the '0.0% decrease' lift and $1,008,925 'Expected Outcome'."
"This log MUST clearly show:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each marketing channel:
Its initial spend.
Its optimized spend as determined in this run.
The key parameters being used for it by the optimizer (beta coefficient, and the actual L, k, x0 for saturation, and adstock parameters as read from Model ID 14's results).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend (after all scaling).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend (after all scaling).
The sum of all channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of all channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome" that was shown in the UI.
The calculated lift percentage, clearly showing the two total outcome values that were compared."
Key Question for You, Agent:

"Why is the logic in the current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py producing such different results from your successful standalone test script (optimize_budget_best.py or similar)? Were all parts of the successful logic (especially regarding how saturation parameters L, k, x0 are used to calculate response, how marginal ROI is derived, and how the baseline sales is incorporated into total outcome) correctly and completely transferred? What might have been missed or changed during the integration?"
Let's pause all further attempts at "enhancements" or "diversity protection." We must first ensure that the fundamental, validated optimization logic from your successful test script is perfectly replicated and demonstrably working within python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py when called by the server. Providing the actual current code and the detailed logs for this specific problematic run is the only way we can help diagnose and fix this.
