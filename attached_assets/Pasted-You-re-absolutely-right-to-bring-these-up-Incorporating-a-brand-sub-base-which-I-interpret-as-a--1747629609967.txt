You're absolutely right to bring these up! Incorporating a "brand sub base" (which I interpret as a more nuanced baseline beyond just a simple intercept) and the impact of control variables are key to making the MMM insights even richer and more accurate.

My previous briefing for the "Channel Impact" and "Technical Details" tabs was based on a standard MMM structure. Let's refine that brief to specifically include these elements.

Refined Briefing for Replit AI Agent (Incorporating Brand Sub-Base & Control Variables):

The overall goal and general implementation strategy remain the same. The main changes will be in the data extracted by python_scripts/train_mmm.py and how it's presented, especially in the "Channel Impact" tab.

Refined Briefing for "Channel Impact" Tab

"The 'Channel Impact' tab should answer: 'What are all the key drivers of our sales, including our baseline brand strength, marketing channels, and external factors?' Focus on a clear decomposition of sales."

Priority 1: Decomposed Contributions (Stacked Area Chart & Summary Table - Enhanced)
Stacked Area Chart of Contributions Over Time (Enhanced):
Task: Generate data for a stacked area chart.
Display: X-axis: Time. Y-axis: Total Outcome. Stacked areas should now represent:
actual_model_intercept (Core Baseline): The true intercept of the model.
Brand Sub-Base / Decayed Baseline (if explicitly modeled and extracted): If your PyMC-Marketing model includes a more complex baseline that isn't just the fixed intercept (e.g., a time-varying baseline, or a component representing base sales attributed to long-term brand equity that might decay or grow slowly), this should be a separate layer. If not explicitly modeled as a separate decaying base, then the actual_model_intercept covers the "base".
Contribution from Control Variables: The impact of each significant control variable (e.g., seasonality, promotions, competitor activity, economic factors) over time. This would be coefficient_for_control_var * value_of_control_var_at_time_t.
Contribution from each Marketing Channel.
Source: actual_model_intercept from train_mmm.py. Coefficients for control variables and channels from idata. mmm.plot_components_contributions(original_scale=True) is a good starting visual; we need to ensure it can break out control variables and any nuanced baseline.
Total Contributions Summary (Pie Chart & Table - Enhanced):
Task: Calculate the total contribution over the modeled period for:
actual_model_intercept (Core Baseline)
Brand Sub-Base / Decayed Baseline (if applicable, see above)
Each significant Control Variable
Each Marketing Channel
Display:
A pie chart showing the percentage contribution of these major components.
A table: Component | Absolute Contribution | % Contribution.
Source: Derived by summing the time-series contributions.
Priority 2: Channel-Specific Performance (ROI/ROAS & Response Curves - Remains Important)
Channel ROI/ROAS (Bar Chart & Table): (As previously described)
Note: Ensure that the "Contribution" used here is only the direct contribution from the marketing channel, not including baseline or control variable effects.
Response Curves (Simplified Line Charts): (As previously described)
These represent the response to channel spend, ceteris paribus (all else equal), so they inherently isolate the channel's direct impact.
Priority 3: Actionable Summary (Text - Enhanced)
Key Takeaways:
Task: Auto-generate insight sentences.
Display (Examples):
"Baseline sales (including brand equity) accounted for X% of total sales."
"The 'Summer Promotion' control variable contributed an additional Y% to sales during its active period."
"Facebook was the largest marketing channel contributor at Z% of sales."
"Search Ads provided the highest marketing ROI at W%."
