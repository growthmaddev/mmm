We have identified MarketMixMaster/budget_optimizer_direct_fix.py as our 'golden optimizer script' (GS). Your task is to modify the live script, MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py (LS), to precisely replicate the logic and achieve the same successful results as the GS.

Key Modifications for MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

Exclusive Logistic Saturation:

Remove the Michaelis-Menten response curve option and any response_type logic.
The script must only use a logistic_saturation_response(spend, L, k, x0) function, identical in calculation to the one in GS.
Beta coefficients are to be applied to the output of this saturation function, not within it.
Adstock Handling (Important Clarification):

The GS (budget_optimizer_direct_fix.py) does not perform an explicit adstock transformation (like calling an apply_adstock function) on spends during its optimization phase.
Therefore, remove any internal adstock calculations from the LS (e.g., calls to apply_adstock within calculate_channel_contribution or its equivalent).
Assumption: For the GS's successful runs, either input spends were already adstocked, or the model parameters (betas, saturation curves) generated by train_mmm.py inherently captured average adstock effects. The optimizer will work with spend values as they are given.
Standardize Parameter Extraction (from model_results_json_str input):

Modify LS to parse the model_results JSON (from model_results_json_str) as follows:
Channel Names: From model_results['account_setup']['model_channel_names'].
Baseline Sales (Intercept): From model_results['model_summary']['intercept']['mean'].
For each channel in channel_names:
Beta Coefficient: From model_results['model_summary']['coefficients'][channel]['mean'].
Saturation L: From model_results['model_summary']['saturation_params'][channel]['L'].
Saturation k: From model_results['model_summary']['saturation_params'][channel]['k'].
Saturation x0: From model_results['model_summary']['saturation_params'][channel]['x0'].
(This implies that train_mmm.py should be saving saturation parameters L, k, x0 under model_summary.saturation_params.<channel_name>.L/k/x0 and the intercept as described. Please ensure this is the case or flag if train_mmm.py needs adjustment separately).
Refactor Core Calculation Logic:

Create a primary function in LS, analogous to GS's calculate_total_response(spends, channel_params, baseline_sales).
This function should accept:
spends: A dictionary {channel_name: spend_value}.
channel_params: A dictionary structured as defined in point 5 below.
baseline_sales: The scalar baseline value.
Inside, it should iterate through each channel in spends:
Retrieve the channel's beta_coeff, L, k, x0 from channel_params.
Calculate contribution: contribution = beta_coeff * logistic_saturation_response(spend, L, k, x0).
Sum these contributions.
Return total_summed_contributions + baseline_sales.
Adopt GS channel_params Structure:

Before the main optimization loop, after extracting all parameters from the input JSON, create a consolidated channel_params dictionary:
Python

# Example structure
# channel_params = {
#     'channelA': {'beta_coeff': 0.5, 'L': 10000, 'k': 0.001, 'x0': 500},
#     'channelB': {'beta_coeff': 0.3, 'L': 15000, 'k': 0.0005, 'x0': 700},
# }
Implement Diversity Enhancement:

The GS was confirmed to have "diversity enhancement." The code showed a commented-out cap (e.g., if temp_spends[channel] > total_budget_optimized * 0.6 ...).
Please implement this diversity mechanism in the LS's optimization loop. When considering adding an increment_amount to a channel, if that channel's new spend would exceed a certain percentage (e.g., 60% or the value from your successful GS test) of the total_budget_optimized, that channel should be skipped for that increment if there are other channels available. Clarify the exact percentage or logic used in the successful GS.
Optimization Loop Parity:

Ensure the iterative budget allocation logic (for both increasing and decreasing total budget based on total_budget_optimized vs initial spend) in LS mirrors GS. This includes the increment_amount (e.g., $100) and how marginal gains/losses are used to select channels.
Logging:

Enhance logging in LS to provide more detailed output for: initial spends, initial calculated outcome, parameters used per channel (briefly), optimized spends, optimized outcome, and final lift. This will be vital for verification through UI tests.
Goal: After these changes, MarketMixMaster/python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, when called by the server with the same Model ID 14 parameters and budget scenarios, should produce the same +27% / +45% lift and ~57% top-2 channel concentration as MarketMixMaster/budget_optimizer_direct_fix.py did in isolation.

Please proceed with these modifications. After you've updated the script, we will need to plan a verification test.
