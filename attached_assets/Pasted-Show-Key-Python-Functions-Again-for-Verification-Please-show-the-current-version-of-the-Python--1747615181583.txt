Show Key Python Functions (Again, for Verification):

Please show the current version of the Python function in optimize_budget_marginal.py that calculates the sales contribution for a single channel (taking spend, beta, adstock, and saturation parameters as input).
Please show the current version of the Python function/section that calculates the total predicted outcome (summing all channel contributions and adding the baseline_sales/intercept).
Please show the current version of the Python function/section that calculates the lift percentage.
Detailed Logged Output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py for Scenario B:

Ensure your script has detailed print() statements, and then execute it with the inputs for Scenario B. Provide the log output showing:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) being used from Model ID 14.
For each channel:
Its initial spend (from the $201,785 allocation).
Its optimized spend (in the $300,000 allocation).
The key parameters being used for it by the optimizer (beta coefficient, and the actual L, k, x0 for saturation, and adstock parameters).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend.
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend.
The sum of all channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the value the "lift" should be based against.
The sum of all channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome" that gets displayed.
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two outcome values used in the comparison.
This detailed trace is essential. The fact that the 'Expected Outcome' is so low and the lift is negative, even with a budget increase, points to a fundamental miscalculation or misuse of the model parameters (especially the intercept or the channel response curves) within the Python optimization script.
