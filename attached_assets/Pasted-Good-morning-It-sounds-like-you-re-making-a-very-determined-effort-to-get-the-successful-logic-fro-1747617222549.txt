Good morning!

It sounds like you're making a very determined effort to get the successful logic from your test script fully integrated into the main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. I understand that working with large scripts and ensuring all changes are correctly applied can be challenging, and your attempts to use an update utility show you're thinking of ways to manage this.

The key remains that the "production" optimize_budget_marginal.py script (the one called by your server) needs to reliably produce the same kind of positive lift and improved budget diversity that you achieved in your isolated budget_optimizer_fix.py or test_optimizer.py.

You mentioned, "Since the regex patterns in our update utility didn't match all sections, I need to apply some of the critical changes more directly. Let me test the current state of the optimizer."

Before you run another full UI test, if you're still in the process of applying changes, here's a suggestion that might help ensure a more complete transfer of the working logic:

Consider a "Function Replacement" Strategy:

Instead of trying to make many small, targeted edits or rely on regex patterns within the existing optimize_budget_marginal.py (which can be error-prone if the structures have diverged significantly), would it be feasible to:
Identify the core function(s) in your successful test script (budget_optimizer_fix.py or test_optimizer.py) that contain the validated budget allocation algorithm (including the correct handling of baseline sales, channel response curves with proper saturation/adstock, marginal ROI calculations, iterative allocation, and lift calculation).
Identify the corresponding main optimization function(s) in the live python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py.
Completely replace the body of these core function(s) in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py with the proven code from your test script.
Ensure that any helper functions, necessary imports, and the way parameters are passed into these core functions are consistent between the test script's version and how they are now structured in optimize_budget_marginal.py.
This "wholesale replacement" of the core algorithmic part with known good code can sometimes be more effective than many small patches.

Whichever method you use to apply the fixes, once you are confident that python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py now fully incorporates the successful logic from your test script:

Confirm Completion of Code Transfer: "Please confirm when you believe python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py has been fully updated to match the logic of your successful test script."

Then, Run Full End-to-End Tests from UI:

"At that point, please run our two standard test scenarios by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:"
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785.
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000.
Report Back with UI Output and Detailed Logs for Scenario B:

"For both scenarios, show the final UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation breakdown, Expected Outcome, and Lift %)."
"For Scenario B, provide the detailed server-side log output from the updated python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, clearly showing:
The baseline_sales (intercept) used.
For each channel: initial spend, optimized spend, parameters used (beta, adstock, saturation L,k,x0), initial contribution, optimized contribution.
Total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (sum of initial contributions + baseline_sales).
Total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (sum of optimized contributions + baseline_sales).
The calculated lift percentage and the two outcome values used."
Let's ensure we get that robust, validated logic from your test script fully operational in the live application. I'm here to review the results once you've completed the code integration and run the tests.
