It sounds like there's a bit of a mix-up in the agent's approach, and your concern is very valid. You are correct: the agent seems to have created a "simplified" version of train_mmm.py that, based on its description, appears to generate synthetic/placeholder data rather than training an actual PyMC-Marketing model and extracting its results.

Let's clarify this immediately, as it's a critical divergence from our goal.

Addressing the Agent's "Simplified" train_mmm.py:

The agent's latest script (the one you provided which includes extensive logging and calculations based on correlations and spend proportions, but no mmm.fit() call or idata processing for PyMC-Marketing) is indeed a way to "ensure the Channel Impact tab always displays data." However, this data would be fabricated, not derived from a real Marketing Mix Model.

Why this is a problem: While this synthetic data generator can help in UI development by providing perfectly structured JSON and preventing "No data available" messages, it does not reflect the actual insights from a user's data processed through a PyMC-Marketing MMM. This would be misleading if presented as real model output.
Our Goal: The objective is for the "Channel Impact" tab to show the results of the actual PyMC-Marketing model that was trained.
Regarding the Stalled Model ID 22 (The PyMC-Marketing Version):

You mentioned the new model training (Model ID 22, which was presumably using the PyMC-Marketing version of train_mmm.py) was running for hours and might be stalled. This is the real issue we need to solve. The agent setting its status to "error" and then switching to a synthetic data generator is a workaround, not a fix for the actual modeling pipeline.

The "simplified" script the agent provided is NOT a fix for train_mmm.py in the context of running actual MMMs. It's a different script entirely that simulates output.

Instructions for the Replit AI Agent (To Get Back on Track):

"Agent, thank you for trying to ensure the UI has data. However, the 'simplified' version of train_mmm.py you've created (which uses correlations and spend proportions to generate data, and doesn't call PyMC-Marketing's mmm.fit()) generates synthetic data, not actual model results.

While this synthetic data might be useful temporarily for UI layout testing, it is not what we need for the 'Channel Impact' tab in the live application. Users must see insights derived from the actual PyMC-Marketing model they trained.

Please set aside the synthetic data generating script for now.

Our priority is to debug and fix the original python_scripts/train_mmm.py that uses PyMC-Marketing so that it:

Completes training without stalling or excessive runtimes (for reasonable MCMC settings and data sizes).
Correctly extracts and saves all the detailed channel_impact data (time-series decomposition for baseline, controls, channels; response curve parameters/data; total contributions; and historical_channel_spends) from the actual idata (PyMC-Marketing inference data) object.
Regarding the Model ID 22 that stalled:

Investigate the Stall in the PyMC-Marketing train_mmm.py:

Action: We need to understand why the PyMC-Marketing version of train_mmm.py took hours for Model ID 22.
Load the version of python_scripts/train_mmm.py that was used for the Model ID 22 training attempt (the one that should have done actual PyMC-Marketing training and detailed data extraction).
Add verbose logging (print statements or use the logging module) throughout this script:
Before and immediately after the mmm.fit() call (to see if MCMC sampling completes and how long it takes).
At the beginning and end of each major data extraction block for the channel_impact section (e.g., "Starting time_series_decomposition extraction," "Finished...", "Starting response curve data extraction," "Finished...").
Temporarily use very minimal MCMC settings (e.g., draws=20, tune=20, chains=1) and a small, known test dataset (like test_data.csv if it's small, or a few dozen rows of dankztestdata.csv).
Run this heavily logged, minimal version of the PyMC-Marketing train_mmm.py.
Examine the logs to see where it's spending excessive time or if it's getting stuck in a loop during the post-MCMC data extraction phases.
If the Minimal Run Completes & Generates JSON:

Action: Provide the generated JSON output from this minimal run of the PyMC-Marketing train_mmm.py. We need to verify if the channel_impact section is correctly populated with data derived from the (albeit small) idata.
If the Minimal Run Still Stalls or Errors:

Action: Report the last log message seen before the stall, or any new error messages. This will help pinpoint the problematic code in the PyMC-Marketing train_mmm.py script's data extraction logic.
The synthetic/simplified script is a detour. We need to fix the actual PyMC-Marketing training and data extraction pipeline in train_mmm.py so it produces real, model-derived channel_impact data without excessive delays or errors.
