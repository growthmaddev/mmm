Agent, thank you for running the tests. The user's observations are spot on. The Budget Optimizer's output, specifically the 'Expected Outcome' being equal to the input budget and the resulting '0% lift', indicates a critical flaw in how python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is calculating the predicted total sales.

We need to urgently debug the Python script. Please focus on the following within python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

Code for get_channel_response (or similar function):

"Please show me the exact Python function that calculates the predicted sales contribution for a single channel. This function should take the channel's spend, its beta_coefficient, its adstock_parameters (e.g., alpha, l_max), and its saturation_parameters (e.g., L, k, x0 for LogisticSaturation) as input.
We need to meticulously review how it applies adstock, then saturation, and then the beta coefficient to the spend to arrive at that channel's predicted sales contribution."
Code for Calculating Total Predicted Outcome (Crucial):

"Show me the exact Python function or section of code that:
Takes a full budget allocation (spend for each channel).
Calls the get_channel_response function (from point 1) for each channel to get its individual contribution.
Sums these individual channel contributions.
Adds the baseline_sales (intercept value from the original MMM model, e.g., Model ID 14) to this sum.
"This final sum should be the predicted_optimized_outcome. We need to ensure the baseline_sales is correctly retrieved and added."
Code for Lift Calculation:

"Show me how the '% lift' is being calculated. Specifically:
How does the script calculate the predicted_outcome for the initial/current budget allocation? (It should use the same logic as in point 2: sum of individual channel responses based on initial spends + baseline_sales).
The lift should then be ((predicted_optimized_outcome / predicted_initial_outcome) - 1) * 100."
Add Detailed Logging to Python Script (and show it):

"Please add (or ensure you have) print() statements inside python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py to output the following when it runs for Scenario B (desired budget $300,000):
The baseline_sales (intercept) value it's using.
For each channel: its allocated spend in the optimized budget, and its calculated sales contribution from the get_channel_response function.
The sum of all channel contributions before adding the baseline.
The final predicted_optimized_outcome (after adding the baseline).
The calculated predicted_initial_outcome (for the $201,785 budget) used for the lift calculation.
The calculated lift percentage."
Hypothesis:
My strong suspicion is that either:
a. The baseline_sales (intercept) is not being added when calculating the total predicted outcome, OR
b. The get_channel_response function is incorrectly implemented such that the sum of "contributions" is simply reflecting the sum of "spends" (minus some small amount that gets allocated to $1000 minimums).

Let's see the relevant Python code sections and the detailed log output from a test run of Scenario B. This will allow us to pinpoint the error in the calculation logic."
