It's excellent that you're diving deep into python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py and have identified these critical areas for improvement. Your diagnosis aligns perfectly with the strange results we were seeing (the very low/zero lift and extreme budget allocations).

The issues you've pinpointed are indeed fundamental:

Incorrect Saturation Parameters (Especially 'L' values being too small): If the 'L' parameter (the maximum potential sales/contribution ceiling for a channel) used in the optimizer is too low, the model will predict that channels saturate very quickly and can't contribute much, regardless of spend. This would absolutely lead to artificially low overall outcomes and skewed allocations. It's crucial that the optimizer is using the correctly fitted 'L' values for each channel from the PyMC-Marketing model run (e.g., Model ID 14).
Marginal Return Calculation Issues: This is the core of the optimizer. If the calculation of how much additional sales we get from the next dollar spent isn't accurate, the entire allocation logic will be flawed. This needs to correctly reflect the shape of the response curve (defined by adstock and saturation).
Parameter Imbalance (Symptom): The heavy favoring of a few channels is likely a direct result of the two points above.
It's great that you're now implementing a "comprehensive fix." As you edit python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, please focus on:

Correctly Sourcing and Using Saturation 'L' (and other) Parameters: Ensure the script accurately retrieves the fitted 'L', 'k', and 'x0' (or equivalent for LogisticSaturation) for each channel from the model.results JSON and uses these specific values in its response curve calculations. Double-check that these parameters are on the correct scale.
Accurate Marginal Return Calculation: Verify the mathematical formula or numerical approximation used to calculate the marginal return for each channel given its current spend level and its unique response curve parameters.
Total Outcome Calculation: Reconfirm that the total predicted outcome (used for calculating lift) correctly sums the contributions from all channels (based on their response curves at the optimized spend) AND adds the baseline_sales (intercept).
After you've implemented your comprehensive fix in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py:

Please describe the key changes you made, particularly to how saturation is handled and how marginal returns are calculated.
Then, let's run a test scenario using the same inputs as before (e.g., Model ID 14, current budget $201,785, desired budget $300,000).
Report back on the new optimized allocation, the new 'Expected Outcome', and the new 'Lift %'.
If possible, also include some intermediate logging or outputs from the Python script for this test run that show:
The saturation parameters (L, k, x0) being used for a few key channels (e.g., OfflineMedia, PPCBrand, and one channel that was previously zeroed out).
The calculated marginal return for these channels at an early stage of optimization and perhaps at a later stage.
The final predicted contribution from each channel and the baseline_sales value used to sum to the total "Expected Outcome."
This detailed approach should help us confirm that the optimizer is now working with correct parameters and logic, leading to more realistic and valuable recommendations. I'm looking forward to seeing the results of your fixes!
