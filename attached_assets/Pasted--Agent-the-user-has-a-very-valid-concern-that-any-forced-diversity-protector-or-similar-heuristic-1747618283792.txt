"Agent, the user has a very valid concern that any 'forced diversity protector' or similar heuristic might be arbitrary and not based on sound modeling principles, potentially overriding the marginal return logic we've been aiming for. There's also a concern that we might have lost some of the successful logic that was present in your earlier test scripts (like test_optimizer.py or budget_optimizer_fix.py) which showed better lift and better diversity simultaneously.

Let's clarify and refocus:

Core Optimization Principle: Our primary goal for python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is to perform optimization based on marginal returns derived from the accurately modeled response curves (adstock, saturation, beta coefficients) for each channel, using the parameters fitted by PyMC-Marketing (e.g., from Model ID 14). Any "diversity enhancement" should ideally be a secondary consideration or a set of optional business constraints applied after we understand the unconstrained or minimally constrained optimum.

Revisit Successful Test Script Logic:

"Please confirm if the core logic (especially for calculating channel response, marginal ROI, and the iterative allocation) in the current python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is identical to, or a direct and complete port of, the logic from your most successful test script (the one that produced results like +27.71% lift for the same budget and +45.15% lift for the increased budget with ~57% concentration in the top 2 channels)."
"If there are differences, or if 'diversity enhancements' were layered on top in a way that might be conflicting, let's prioritize getting back to that known good core logic first."
Transparency in Calculation (Critical Next Step):

"Regardless of the above, we must see the detailed calculation trace to understand the current behavior. Please, using the current version of python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, run Scenario B (Initial Budget $201,785, Desired Budget $300,000, using Model ID 14 parameters)."
"Provide the complete server-side log output from this run, clearly showing:
The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each marketing channel:
Its initial spend.
Its optimized spend.
The key parameters being used for it by the optimizer (beta coefficient, and the actual L, k, x0 for saturation, and adstock parameters).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend (after all scaling).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend (after all scaling).
The sum of all channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of all channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales). This is the "Expected Outcome."
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values that were compared.
"Also, please provide the UI output for this Scenario B run."
Let's pause any further "enhancements" like forced diversity or scaling factor adjustments until we have absolute clarity and verification that the fundamental marginal return optimization, based on the model's fitted parameters and including the baseline sales correctly, is working as expected and is accurately reflecting the logic that previously showed more promising and balanced results in your test script. We need to build confidence in this core calculation engine first.
