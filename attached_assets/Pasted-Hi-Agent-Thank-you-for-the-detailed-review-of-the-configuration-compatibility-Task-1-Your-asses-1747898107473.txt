Hi Agent,

Thank you for the detailed review of the configuration compatibility (Task 1). Your assessment confirms:
* `train_mmm.py` now accepts new parameters for target transformation, predictor scaling, and auto-transformation, all with sensible defaults.
* The current frontend model setup process will NOT break and can still initiate training runs; `train_mmm.py` will simply use its new default behaviors for these features.
* Users cannot yet control these new features from the UI (this will be a future frontend update task after we validate these backend enhancements).

Please now proceed with **Task 2 and Task 3** from my previous prompt ("Test Run of Enhanced `train_mmm.py` (with Frontend Compatibility Check)"):

**Task 2: Conduct a Test Model Run with Enhanced `train_mmm.py`**
    a.  **Data:** Use the "real client data" (e.g., `dankztestdata.csv` or the dataset associated with model 26).
    b.  **Prepare `config_json` for Test:** Manually construct a `config_json` object that explicitly enables and tests some of the new features you've implemented. For example:
        * Set `auto_transform_target: true` (to test the automatic recommendation for target variable).
        * Or, specify a direct target transformation: `transform_target_method: 'log'` (or `'boxcox'` if you believe the data suits it).
        * Set a predictor scaling method: `scale_predictors_method: 'standardize'`.
        * Ensure all other necessary existing config parameters (`dateColumn`, `targetColumn`, `channelColumns`, etc.) are correctly included.
    c.  **MCMC Settings:** Use faster MCMC settings for this test run (e.g., `draws=200, tune=100, chains=2`).
    d.  **Execute Model Training:** Run `train_mmm.py` with this prepared `config_json`.

**Task 3: Report Results and Findings**
    a.  Provide the **full JSON output** from this test model run. We are very interested in seeing:
        i.  The entire `"data_diagnostics_report"` section.
        ii. Details of any transformations applied (target and predictors), and if auto-recommended, the reasoning if logged by the script.
        iii.The key model fit metrics: **R-squared** (`model_accuracy / 100`) and **RMSE**.
        iv. The **`raw_per_period_intercept`**, **`total_baseline_sales`** (`summary.actual_model_intercept`), and **`baseline_percent_of_total`**.
        v.  Observations on the reported **adstock and saturation parameters** for key channels â€“ do they appear more varied and data-driven now with your latest enhancements to their handling?

This test run is crucial for evaluating the impact of the extensive backend improvements.
