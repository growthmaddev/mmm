Are you certain that all the successful logic improvements (related to scaling, saturation handling, lift calculation, and diversity) that produced the positive lift figures (+27.71% and +45.15%) have been saved and are active in the specific python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py file that the Node.js controller calls?"
"Sometimes changes are tested in a separate script (like test_optimizer.py) or a different environment. We need to ensure these fixes are in the operational Python script."
Source of Successful Test Results:

"When you reported the successful +27.71% and +45.15% lift figures, were these results obtained by:
(a) Directly executing python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py from the command line or a test harness?
OR (b) Triggering the budget optimization process entirely from the application's frontend UI, which then called the backend, which then executed the updated Python script?"
If the answer to 1 or 2a indicates that the main script might not be fully updated or the test was not fully end-to-end via the UI:

"If the successful logic isn't yet fully active in the server-called python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, please ensure all necessary changes are applied and saved to that script now."
"Then, after confirming the script is updated, please proceed to run our two standard test scenarios by triggering the optimization from the frontend UI, using Model ID 14:"
Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785.
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000.
"And then provide the UI outputs and detailed server-side logs for Scenario B, as requested previously."
If you are certain the main script is updated and the successful tests were fully end-to-end via the UI:

"If you are confident that the main python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is updated and the positive lift results were indeed from a full UI-triggered end-to-end test, then please proceed directly with providing the UI outputs and detailed server-side logs for Scenario B as requested in our last full instruction."
It's essential we're all on the same page about what version of the code is running and how the tests are being performed. Let's ensure the integrated environment reflects all the great progress you've made on the optimization logic
