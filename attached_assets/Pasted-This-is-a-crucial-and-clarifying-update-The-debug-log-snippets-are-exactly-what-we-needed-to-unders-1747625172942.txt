This is a crucial and clarifying update! The debug log snippets are exactly what we needed to understand the underlying calculations.

Excellent Work – The Intercept Mystery is Solved!

Based on your latest report and the debug logs:

DEBUG: Total original contribution: 78.505256
DEBUG: Total optimized contribution: 126.809938
DEBUG: Current outcome: $78.51
DEBUG: Expected outcome: $126.81
DEBUG: Percentage lift: 61.53%
Your interpretation is spot on:

Near-Zero Intercept for Model ID 14: The fact that "Total original contribution" (78.505) is virtually identical to "Current outcome" ($78.51) confirms that the baseline_sales (actual model intercept) value used by the Python script for Model ID 14 is indeed very close to zero. This is a valid outcome for a model; not all models will have a large intercept. The critical achievement here is that the system is now transparently using this actual (near-zero) intercept from Model ID 14, rather than an arbitrary fallback or hardcoded value.

Scaling for UI:

The scaling_factor=300.0 in get_channel_response produces the initial scaled contributions (summing to ~78.51).
The outcome_scale=10000 at the end of optimize_budget then takes these small outcomes (e.g., $78.51) and scales them up for UI display (e.g., 78.51∗10000≈785,100), which aligns with the UI's "Current Outcome" of $785,053. This two-step scaling is now clear and its effect is evident.
Lift Calculation:

The lift is correctly calculated based on these unscaled internal outcomes: (126.81 - 78.51) / 78.51 * 100 \approx 61.53%.
The substantial lift percentages are indeed plausible because the optimization is significantly improving channel allocations, and these improvements are not diluted by a large, fixed baseline amount in the denominator of the lift calculation (since the baseline is near zero).
Allocation Patterns & Diversity:

The optimizer's preference for PPC channels and the demonstrated diversity are excellent signs that the core algorithm, using the model's parameters, is functioning as intended.
Conclusion: Main Goal Achieved!

The primary objective of getting the budget optimizer to correctly use the actual model parameters (including the true intercept) and produce coherent, explainable results has been successfully achieved. The system is now robustly handling the intercept, and the results for Model ID 14, given its specific near-zero intercept, make sense.

Addressing the Agent's Question: "Would you like me to make any additional improvements to ensure these changes will consistently work with future trained models?"

Yes, this is a good point for ensuring long-term stability:

Robust Intercept Extraction in python_scripts/train_mmm.py:

The current extract_model_intercept function (looking for 'intercept', 'Intercept', 'alpha' in summary_df and now correctly returning None if not found) is a good improvement.
To make it even more robust for future models:
Encourage a standard practice where the person defining the MMM model in train_mmm.py explicitly names the intercept term (e.g., pm.Normal("model_intercept", ...)).
The extract_model_intercept function should then prioritize fetching the posterior mean of this explicitly named term directly from the idata (inference data) object (e.g., idata.posterior["model_intercept"].mean().item()). This is generally more direct and less prone to issues than parsing a summary DataFrame, especially if column names in the summary change across PyMC or ArviZ versions.
The current search for common names ('intercept', 'Intercept', 'alpha') can remain as a secondary check if direct idata access for the primary named term fails, but the goal should be to rely on direct extraction of the defined parameter.
No Changes Needed Elsewhere for This:

server/controllers/budgetOptimization.ts is correctly set up to look for "actual_model_intercept".
python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py is correctly set up to use the baseline_sales value passed to it.
The responsibility for providing the correct intercept value lies squarely with python_scripts/train_mmm.py.
Minor Code Clarity Point (Optional):

In python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, the optimize_budget function has a diversity_factor: float = 0.8 parameter in its signature. However, the actual diversity logic uses diversity_adjustment = max(0.1, 1.0 - (channel_percentage * 2.0)), and this is enabled if the passed diversity_factor (the 0.8 value) is > 0. This is functionally fine but could be slightly confusing to a new reader. Consider either:
Renaming the diversity_factor parameter to something like enable_dynamic_diversity_adjustment: bool = True if it's just an on/off switch.
Or, if the 0.8 was intended to be part of the formula, adjusting the formula. (The current formula max(0.1, 1.0 - (channel_percentage * 2.0)) is the one that has been reported as working well).
This is a low-priority cleanup and doesn't affect the current correct functioning.
Overall, this is a successful outcome for this phase of development. The budget optimizer is now working on a solid foundation of actual model parameters. Congratulations to the agent on this excellent progress!
