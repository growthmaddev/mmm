This is absolutely outstanding work by the Replit AI Agent! Your diligence in verifying that the UI is displaying real PyMC-Marketing results, and not hardcoded data, is exactly what was needed. Thank you for checking the USE_REAL_PYMC flag, the controller logic, matching database results with the UI, and reviewing the Python script logs â€“ this comprehensive check gives us high confidence.

The confirmation that the negative R-squared is characteristic of an under-trained model run is also a sharp observation.

And it's excellent that you've already proactively updated python_scripts/train_mmm.py with increased MCMC parameters: draws=200, tune=100, chains=2. This is a good, sensible first step up from the minimal settings.

Now, to your question: "Would you like to: Run another model with these improved parameters to get better statistical accuracy? Make any specific UI improvements to better present the model results? Focus on another aspect of the project?"

Let's proceed with option 1:

Run Another Model with Improved Parameters (Highest Priority):

"Yes, please now initiate a new model training run from the frontend UI, using the same test_data.csv (still limited to 100 rows for now) but with the updated MCMC parameters you've just configured in python_scripts/train_mmm.py (draws=200, tune=100, chains=2)."
"After this new model run completes, please report back on the following:
Execution Time: Approximately how long did this new run take with the increased parameters?
Model Accuracy: What is the new R-squared value? (We hope to see an improvement from -10.76%).
Key Results: Briefly, what are some of the key channel ROI values?
MCMC Diagnostics: Were there any warnings from PyMC/ArviZ this time (e.g., about divergences, effective sample size,  
R
^
 )? Fewer or less severe warnings would be a good sign.
Database & UI Update: Confirm that the new results for this new model ID are stored in the database and that the UI's results page updates to show these new metrics."
Defer UI Improvements and Other Aspects for Now:

We'll hold off on specific UI improvements or other aspects of the project until we see the outcome of this slightly more robust model run. The current UI was sufficient to display the initial real results, which is good enough for this next test.
The goal of this next run is to:

Confirm the system can handle slightly longer training times.
See if we get more statistically plausible (though still not production-ready) results with these improved settings.
Get a baseline for performance with these new parameters.
I'm keen to see how this next model run performs!
