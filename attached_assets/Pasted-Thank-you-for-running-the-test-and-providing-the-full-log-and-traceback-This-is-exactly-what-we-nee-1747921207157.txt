Thank you for running the test and providing the full log and traceback! This is exactly what we needed.
The new error is: `AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'dims'`, occurring in `pymc_marketing/mmm/mmm.py` at line 658.

This happens because the `MMM` class, when building its default model configuration, inspects the priors from the adstock/saturation objects. When it encounters our fixed float values (e.g., `alpha=0.5`), it tries to access a `.dims` attribute which floats don't have.

To fix this, we need to wrap our fixed float parameters with `pm.Constant.dist()` when creating the `GeometricAdstock` and `LogisticSaturation` objects.

Please modify the `train_model` function in `python_scripts/train_mmm.py` as follows:

Inside the loop `for channel_name_key in channel_columns:`, where `adstock_obj` and `saturation_obj` are created:

1.  **For `GeometricAdstock`:**
    * Change:
        ```python
        adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha})
        ```
    * To (import `pymc as pm` if not already at the top of the script):
        ```python
        alpha_const = pm.Constant.dist(alpha) # alpha is the float value
        adstock_obj = GeometricAdstock(l_max=l_max, priors={"alpha": alpha_const})
        ```

2.  **For `LogisticSaturation`:**
    * Change:
        ```python
        saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L, "k": k, "x0": x0})
        ```
    * To:
        ```python
        L_const = pm.Constant.dist(L)
        k_const = pm.Constant.dist(k)
        x0_const = pm.Constant.dist(x0)
        saturation_obj = LogisticSaturation(priors={"L": L_const, "k": k_const, "x0": x0_const})
        ```

Ensure `import pymc as pm` is present at the top of `train_mmm.py`.

These changes should make our fixed parameters compatible with the internal workings of the `MMM` class in `pymc-marketing==0.13.1`.

After you've made these exact modifications, please confirm, and I will run the quick verification test again with `test_config_quick.json`.
