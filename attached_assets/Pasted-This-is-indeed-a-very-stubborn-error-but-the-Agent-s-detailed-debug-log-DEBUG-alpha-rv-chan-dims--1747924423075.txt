This is indeed a very stubborn error, but the Agent's detailed debug log (DEBUG: alpha_rv_chan.dims: NO DIMS ATTRIBUTE) is the smoking gun we needed!

Here's the situation:

Agent's Last Attempt: The Agent implemented the "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy (e.g., alpha_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_alphas_per_channel", mu=alpha_values_array, sigma=1e-6, dims="channel")) in a new script, likely python_scripts/mmm_fixed_dims.py.
Persistent Error: The test run (python test_fixed_dims_mmm.py) still failed with AttributeError: 'TensorVariable' object has no attribute 'dims'.
The Crucial Debug Output:
DEBUG: alpha_rv_chan type: <class 'pytensor.tensor.variable.TensorVariable'>
DEBUG: alpha_rv_chan.dims: NO DIMS ATTRIBUTE
DEBUG: alpha_rv_chan.name: fixed_alphas_per_channel
This tells us definitively that even when we create a named PyMC Random Variable like pm.Normal("some_name", ..., dims="channel") within an explicit pm.Model context, the resulting TensorVariable object (in this specific PyMC v5 / PyTensor environment used by pymc-marketing==0.13.1) does not have a directly accessible .dims attribute at the point it's being created or when MMM.default_model_config inspects it.
This is highly unexpected because one would assume a named RV, especially one given explicit dims, would have this attribute. It points to a subtlety in how these attributes are finalized or exposed in this version combination, or how pymc-marketing accesses them.

The Way Forward: Monkey-Patching the .dims Attribute

Since the MMM class in pymc-marketing==0.13.1 hardcodes the check if dist.dims != ("channel",): and our TensorVariable objects (representing our "fixed" priors) lack this .dims attribute directly, the most pragmatic next step is to "monkey-patch" this attribute onto them. This is what the Agent is now suggesting, and it aligns with Claude's "Solution 4" as a last resort.

A monkey-patch means we will dynamically add the .dims attribute to our RV objects after they are created but before they are used by MMM.

Here's how to instruct the Replit AI Agent to implement this (in python_scripts/mmm_fixed_dims.py or its equivalent):

Thank you, Agent. The debug output showing "alpha_rv_chan.dims: NO DIMS ATTRIBUTE" is extremely clear and confirms the root cause of this persistent error. Even named PyMC Random Variables with `dims="channel"` are not presenting the `.dims` attribute directly on the `TensorVariable` object in the way `pymc-marketing==0.13.1` expects.

Given this, your suggestion to try a more direct approach like a "monkey-patch" is the most logical next step. Let's implement this:

**Please modify your `python_scripts/mmm_fixed_dims.py` (the one using the "Channel-Dimensioned Global Priors" strategy) as follows:**

Inside the `with pm.Model(coords={"channel": channel_name_list}) as mmm_model_context:` block, immediately after you define each channel-dimensioned "fixed" prior Random Variable (like `alpha_rv_chan`, `L_rv_chan`, etc.), add a check and then manually assign the expected `.dims` attribute to it.

1.  **After defining `alpha_rv_chan`:**
    ```python
    # ... (alpha_values array is created) ...
    alpha_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_alphas_per_channel", mu=alpha_values, sigma=1e-6, dims="channel")
    if not hasattr(alpha_rv_chan, 'dims'):
        print(f"DEBUG: Monkey-patching .dims for alpha_rv_chan", file=sys.stderr)
        alpha_rv_chan.dims = ("channel",) # Forcibly assign the expected dims tuple
    # Claude's debug print would be useful here too:
    print(f"DEBUG: AFTER PATCH alpha_rv_chan type: {type(alpha_rv_chan)}, hasattr .dims: {hasattr(alpha_rv_chan, 'dims')}, .dims value: {getattr(alpha_rv_chan, 'dims', 'NOT FOUND')}", file=sys.stderr)
    ```

2.  **Do the same for `L_rv_chan`, `k_rv_chan`, and `x0_rv_chan`:**
    * After `L_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_Ls_per_channel", mu=L_values, sigma=1e-6, dims="channel")`:
        ```python
        if not hasattr(L_rv_chan, 'dims'):
            print(f"DEBUG: Monkey-patching .dims for L_rv_chan", file=sys.stderr)
            L_rv_chan.dims = ("channel",)
        # Optional: print debug for L_rv_chan
        ```
    * After `k_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_ks_per_channel", mu=k_values, sigma=k_sigma_val, dims="channel")`:
        ```python
        if not hasattr(k_rv_chan, 'dims'):
            print(f"DEBUG: Monkey-patching .dims for k_rv_chan", file=sys.stderr)
            k_rv_chan.dims = ("channel",)
        # Optional: print debug for k_rv_chan
        ```
    * After `x0_rv_chan = pm.Normal("fixed_x0s_per_channel", mu=x0_values, sigma=x0_sigma_val, dims="channel")`:
        ```python
        if not hasattr(x0_rv_chan, 'dims'):
            print(f"DEBUG: Monkey-patching .dims for x0_rv_chan", file=sys.stderr)
            x0_rv_chan.dims = ("channel",)
        # Optional: print debug for x0_rv_chan
        ```

3.  **The rest of the script should remain the same:**
    * These "patched" RVs (`alpha_rv_chan`, etc.) are then used in the `priors` of the global `GeometricAdstock` and `LogisticSaturation` objects.
    * The `MMM` object is initialized with these global transform objects (inside the `with pm.Model()` block, and *without* the `model=` argument as that caused Pydantic errors).

This monkey-patch directly provides the `.dims` attribute that the `if dist.dims != ("channel",):` line in `pymc-marketing` is looking for.

Please:
a.  Implement this monkey-patching logic carefully in `python_scripts/mmm_fixed_dims.py`.
b.  Then, run your `test_fixed_dims_mmm.py` script with `test_config_quick.json`.
c.  Provide the full console output.

If this works, it's a targeted workaround for this specific version incompatibility. If it still fails, the issue is even more subtle.
