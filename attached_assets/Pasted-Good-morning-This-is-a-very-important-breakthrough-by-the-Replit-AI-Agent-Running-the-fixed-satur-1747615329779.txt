Good morning!

This is a very important breakthrough by the Replit AI Agent! Running the fixed_saturation.py test and diagnosing the issue with how the saturation curves are being modeled, specifically: "With parameters set to L=1.0, k=0.0005, x0=50000, no meaningful response happens until spend approaches $50,000 (the x0 midpoint)," is a critical insight.

This diagnosis directly explains the symptoms we've been seeing (extremely low "Expected Outcome," negative or zero lift, and bizarre budget allocations).

Let's break this down:

L=1.0 (Max Asymptote/Ceiling): If the 'L' parameter, which represents the maximum possible contribution a channel can make due to saturation, is set to 1.0 (e.g., $1 in sales, or 1 unit of your KPI), then that channel, by definition in the model, can effectively contribute almost nothing to the total sales volume, regardless of how much you spend on it. If most or all channels have such an 'L' value, the total marketing-driven sales will be incredibly small.
x0=50000 (Midpoint/Inflection Point): If the midpoint of the saturation curve (where the response is steepest and half of 'L' is achieved) is at $50,000 spend, but 'L' is only 1.0, it means you spend a huge amount to get a tiny fraction of an already tiny maximum response.
This combination would indeed lead to:

The optimizer correctly (based on these flawed parameters) allocating very little or nothing to such channels.
The total predicted outcome (sum of these tiny channel contributions + baseline) being very low and not increasing meaningfully with more budget.
Now, the crucial question is why these parameters (L=1.0, k=0.0005, x0=50000) are being used by the optimizer.

Before the agent proceeds with "improving the saturation parameters for better distribution" within optimize_budget_marginal.py, we need to understand their origin:

My instruction to the Replit AI Agent is:

"Agent, that's an excellent diagnosis regarding the saturation parameters (L=1.0, k=0.0005, x0=50000) and their impact. This is very likely the root cause of the issues we're seeing with the Budget Optimizer.

Before you implement fixes in optimize_budget_marginal.py to 'improve' these parameters:

Source of these Saturation Parameters:

"Are these specific values (L=1.0, k=0.0005, x0=50000) the actual fitted saturation parameters that were saved in the results JSON from Model ID 14 for most/all of the channels?"
"Or, are these values appearing due to a default setting, a fallback, or an error in how optimize_budget_marginal.py is currently reading or interpreting the actual fitted saturation parameters from the results JSON of Model ID 14?"
If they are the Actual Fitted Parameters from Model ID 14:

If train_mmm.py (during the training of Model ID 14) actually estimated L=1.0 for many channels, then Model ID 14, despite its good R-squared, is telling us that most marketing channels have a negligible maximum impact on sales. The R-squared might be high because the baseline/intercept was well-fitted and channels genuinely didn't contribute much according to that model fit.
In this case, the optimizer using L=1.0 would be correctly reflecting the (flawed) insights from Model ID 14. The problem then wouldn't be the optimizer's logic itself, but the parameters it's being fed from that particular model run.
If this is the case, "improving the saturation parameters" within the optimizer might mean the optimizer would be deviating from what the trained MMM actually learned. The longer-term fix would be to improve the model training process in train_mmm.py (e.g., better priors for L, k, x0; checking data scaling for model training) to produce more realistic fitted saturation parameters in future model runs.
If they are NOT the Actual Fitted Parameters (i.e., an Optimizer Bug):

If Model ID 14 did save more realistic L, k, x0 values in its results JSON, but optimize_budget_marginal.py is somehow defaulting to or misusing them, resulting in it thinking L=1.0, then the fix is indeed within optimize_budget_marginal.py to correctly load and use the true fitted parameters.
Please clarify this first: When optimize_budget_marginal.py runs for Model ID 14, what are the actual saturation parameter values (L, k, x0 for each channel) that it reads from the results JSON of Model ID 14 before it starts its optimization?

Understanding this will tell us whether we need to fix:
a. The optimizer's logic for reading/using parameters (if it's misinterpreting good parameters).
b. Or if we need to acknowledge that Model ID 14 itself produced these problematic saturation parameters, and any "fix" in the optimizer would be a temporary override (while the real fix would be in future model training).

Once we know the source, then your plan to 'fix the core of the optimizer by improving the saturation parameters for better distribution' can be more targeted. If you are proceeding to edit optimize_budget_marginal.py now, please explain how the fixes you are making relate to what the script reads from the model's results versus any internal adjustments it might be making.
