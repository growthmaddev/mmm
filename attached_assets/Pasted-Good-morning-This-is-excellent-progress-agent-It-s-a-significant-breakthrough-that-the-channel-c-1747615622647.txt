Good morning!

This is excellent progress, agent! It's a significant breakthrough that the channel contributions are now being correctly calculated and scaled, and we're seeing meaningful contribution values (e.g., PPCBrand $21,823, PPCPMax $7,188) and varied ROIs. This indicates the fixes to the scaling and individual channel response curve calculations are taking effect.

However, as you've rightly pointed out, the persistent negative lift (you mentioned -3% and then a -45% issue you're targeting) is still the critical problem we need to solve. This, along with ensuring appropriate budget diversity, is the right focus.

You're planning to: "fix the diversity enhancement and the negative lift issue (-45%) by implementing the code that ensures proper budget distribution among channels and calculates lift correctly."

This sounds like the correct next step. As you implement these changes in python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py, please pay very close attention to:

Calculation of Total Predicted Outcome (for both initial/current and optimized allocations):

Ensure that for any given budget allocation (the user's initial one OR the optimizer's recommended one), the total predicted outcome is calculated as: Total Predicted Outcome = (Sum of all individual scaled channel contributions for that allocation) + baseline_sales (intercept from Model ID 14)
The baseline_sales (intercept) must be consistently and correctly added in both calculations. This is often a source of error in lift calculations.
Lift Calculation Logic:

The lift percentage should be calculated as: Lift % = ((Total Predicted Outcome for Optimized Allocation / Total Predicted Outcome for Initial Allocation) - 1) * 100
If this logic is correct, and the total predicted outcomes are calculated correctly (including the baseline), then the lift percentage should accurately reflect the benefit (or disbenefit) of the optimization.
"Diversity Enhancement":

As you implement this, consider how it interacts with the marginal return logic. The goal is realistic and actionable recommendations.
After you have implemented these fixes and improvements:

Please briefly describe the core changes you made specifically to address the negative lift calculation and to enhance budget diversity.

Then, let's run our two standard test scenarios again using Model ID 14:

Scenario A: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $201,785
Scenario B: Initial budget $201,785, Desired total budget = $300,000
For Scenario B (the increased budget scenario), please provide the detailed logged output from python_scripts/optimize_budget_marginal.py. This log is crucial and should clearly show:

The baseline_sales (intercept value) used.
For each channel:
Its initial spend.
Its optimized spend.
Its calculated sales contribution based on its initial spend (after scaling).
Its calculated sales contribution based on its optimized spend (after scaling).
The sum of all channel contributions for the initial allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the initial allocation (this sum + baseline_sales).
The sum of all channel contributions for the optimized allocation.
The total predicted outcome for the optimized allocation (this sum + baseline_sales) â€“ this is the "Expected Outcome."
The calculated lift percentage, showing the two total outcome values used in the comparison.
Finally, show the UI output (Optimized Budget Allocation, Expected Outcome, Lift %) for both Scenario A and Scenario B.

Getting the lift calculation right is paramount. If the individual channel contributions are now correct, the issue likely lies in how these are aggregated into a total outcome and how the "before" and "after" outcomes are compared.

I'm looking forward to seeing the results after these targeted fixes!
