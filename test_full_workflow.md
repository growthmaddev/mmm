# Full Workflow Integration Test

## Test Steps:
1. Create new project
2. Upload test data (dankztestdata_v2.csv)
3. Map columns (Date, Sales, Channels, Controls)
4. Configure model parameters
5. Run training with fixed params
6. View results (all tabs)
7. Run budget optimizer

## Expected Results:
- [ ] Data uploads with DD/MM/YYYY dates parsed correctly
- [ ] Numeric columns with commas cleaned automatically
- [ ] Model trains using fit_mmm_fixed_params.py
- [ ] Results show ROI, contributions, decomposition
- [ ] Budget optimizer provides recommendations

## Current Issues:
- Need to verify each step uses our improvements
- Some UI components may expect different result formats
- Additional MM features (curves, scenarios) not implemented
